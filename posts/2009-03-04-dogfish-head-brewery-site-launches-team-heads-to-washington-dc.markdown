On March 3rd, 2009, Inclind Inc launched the brand new front and back end for <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Brewery</a>. It&#39;s almost a year to the day that Inclind began planning the new <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> website and the features it would include in the first phase of the launch. The end result is a culmination of a years worth of blood, sweat, pizza and tears of hard work and dedication. Their new site has everything they have been wanting and more. <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> can now easily manage their 800 page (and growing!) website, all its users, media, newsletters, news articles, events, RSS feeds, and comments. They can add/remove &#39;locations&#39; of where their product is sold, served, or distributed. This allows customers to log in and see where they can find Dogfish on the &#39;<a href="http://www.dogfish.com/community/fish-findin.htm" target="_blank">Fish Finder</a>&#39;. Try it out! With that, the new site features a fully functioning community section and social network. Users can register on the website for an account, after which they can create a basic profile. From there, they have access to submit a map location to their Fish Finder, add or comment on threads in the Forum, submit questions to Dogfish staff in Ask Dogfish, comment on Dogfish staff blogs (Blogfish), and connect with other Dogfish loving fans. All applicable content is able to be sent instantly through Twitter/Digg/MySpace/Facebook/etc in a single click of the &#39;Share&#39; button. We really went all out to flesh out the community side and give users stuff to do in between staff blogs and answering questions. Our new system that was used on <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> has no official name yet, or I&#39;d tell you what it is ha. We hope to have that nailed down soon. What I can tell you is that its the most feature complete, stable and scalable CMS you are going to find on the east coast. I would put it up against anything the competition has to offer from Maine to Florida with confidence ours is as on par or better than what else is available. Since the code is modular, its not coded for 1 strict specific project (as we used to) but rather, any client who comes in the door can have the same power, accessibility, UI and functionality of big time folk like Dogfish. In other words, it makes our platform highly scalable and consistent. All ya gotta do is <a href="http://www.inclind.com/contact.htm">ask us</a>. As for the rest of the week, Pete, Trey and Kevin are representing Inclind at DrupalCon in Washington DC. They will be talking to fellow developers and programmers and sharing / showing off work. You can follow what we&#39;re up to on our <a href="http://twitter.com/inclindinc" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (either by going to the <a href="http://twitter.com/inclindinc" target="_blank">Twitter</a> site, or the side of our page on this site, or adding us <a href="http://twitter.com/inclindinc" target="_blank">inclindinc</a>).
