Are you interested in starting a business in 2010? Why not! Start an LLC, <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">it's easy</a>, and Rick Bell and the folks at Harvard Business Services can get you jumpstarted into <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">forming your own LLC</a> right away at <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">Delaware LLC (http://www.delawarellc.com)</a>. <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank"></a> What is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" target="_blank">LLC</a>? <em>A limited liability company or a company with limited liability (abbreviated L.L.C. or LLC or W.L.L) in the law of the vast majority of United States jurisdictions is a legal form of business company that provides limited liability to its owners. Often incorrectly called a "limited liability corporation" (instead of company), it is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.</em> <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">Delaware LLC</a> is built on our custom Drupal CMS package. It was designed from the ground up by Creative Director Kevin Howett, and put together in a collaborative effort between newcomer Matt Oseland, Kevin Howett and Bryan Cordrey. Efforts were focused on a pleasing, business-minded design, effective search engine optimization, and funneling/encouraging customers to begin the process of <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">forming an LLC in Delaware</a>. As Rick's customers go to him and Harvard Business Services for their LLC/incorporation expertise, Rick came to <a href="http://www.inclind.com" target="_blank">Inclind</a> for our expertise in clean, effective websites and powerful web application development under Drupal and our deep knowledge of content management systems such as Drupal. We also got to flex our system integration skills with Drupal, PHP and Coldfusion. <h3> About Delaware LLC &amp; Harvard Business Services</h3> With more than 25 years of experience, over 20,000 clients worldwide, and offices in both the United States and Europe, Harvard Business Services, Inc. is the premier provider of registered agent and business formation solutions. Rick Bell formed Harvard Business Services, Inc. in March, 1981. Competitors then were big and well established. But Rick conducted business with a philosophy that allowed Harvard not just to survive but to thrive, emerging over time to become an acknowledged leader in the business formation industry. His philosophy focused on a highly personalized style of customer service, understanding that beyond the mechanics of forming a business there were dreams and aspirations. A customer's individual questions and concerns were important and special, and that's how they were treated. Rick also decided that a customer's business formation costs should be fixed, predictable, affordable, and customers should get a lot of value for their money. After almost 30 years and tens of thousands of business formations later, that same approach is still the signature of our culture and way of doing business: speed, efficiency, expertise and affordability, all delivered with the Harvard legacy of personal service.
