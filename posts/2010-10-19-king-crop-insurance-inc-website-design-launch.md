<a href="" target="_blank">King Crop Insurance, Inc</a>. is this region's main insurance providers to farmers. They offer crop and dairy insurance to Delaware, Maryland &amp; Virginia farm owners. <a href="" target="_blank">King Crop</a> approached Inclind in hopes for a fresh website designed with growth in mind. This website is engineered for scalability, and will be hosting some very cool features in the near future. Using <a href="/cms/drupal-cms.htm" title="Drupal Content Management System">Drupal</a> as a base for <a href="http://www.kingcrop.com" target="_blank">King Crop's</a> content management system, we designed the site at a high level to prepare for loads of additional content and some pretty sweet features in the near future. This site is going to be a staple for many farmers utilizing the internet and web applications to boost their business. Using rugged features, we designed the site to be clean, but approachable. <a href="http://www.kingcrop.com" target="_blank">King Crop's</a> clientele isn't interested in stuffy or corporate, and we designed the website to make them feel right at home as they frequent the new site.
