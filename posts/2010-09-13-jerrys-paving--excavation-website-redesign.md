Jerry’s Inc. approached Inclind in need of a website redesign, and we were, of course, happy to oblige. Their former website had about 5 pages, no content management system, and yearned for a facelift. Using our Drupal CMS framework, we built a strong, secure website which Jerry’s can update content at their whim &amp; add pages to the website and menus. The custom website redesign stemmed form their services. Rather than merely apply gradients and colors, we utilized some elements that instantly embed the idea of paving and roadwork into the user’s visit. The double-striped underlines for links and headings resemble lane markings, and the Calls-to-Action look like road signs that would help guide you along your journey, much like a good website should do for it’s “traffic.” It was a true pleasure working with the Jerry’s Inc., team, and we look forward to a continued relationship with this awesome crew.
