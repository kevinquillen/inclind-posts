Mark Tomlinson is a native Delawarean who, like <a href="/about/index.htm">most of Inclind</a>, attended the University of Delaware obtaining a Bachelors in Business Management. Mark completed an internship at Citi Bank for all four years of his studies at UD. He also played ice hockey for a majority of his life and plays on men's league team.  Mark enjoys hanging out with friends and always down to try a new craft beer. While in college, Mark came up with idea to start bluehenlife.com after college and a friend of his introduced him to Drupal and other web development technologies.  He will be taking on project management here at Inclind as our client/project list has grown tremendously since 2009. He will be assisting myself in helping us maintain our work and continue growing in a positive direction much more smoothly.  Welcome Mark!  We're still keeping an eye out for passionate, creative people to join our team! If you're out there, don't be shy! Show us what you've got!
