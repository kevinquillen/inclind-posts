The idea for <a href="/our-work/chockababy/detail.htm">Chockababy</a> was born out of a necessity for a site that allowed parents and expecting parents to post information about their little ones and share it with family/friends outside of giant systems like Facebook.  Founders Nichole Mann and Carrie Curry wanted a place to easily track and share a child's development from the early stages through preschool years. They also wanted to keep information safe, private, and create an engaging environment for parents and families.  <a href="/our-work/chockababy/detail.htm">Chockababy</a> is <a href="/cms/drupal-cms.htm">powered by Drupal awesomeness</a> and sports a custom web design by our <a href="/about/index.htm">graphic design team</a>Â (Leif Osmundson &amp; Shaun Tyndall). Users can join the site and begin sharing in under 60 seconds, or faster if they register using their Facebook account. After just one month, they are already up to 200 proud registered parents! <h2>Features</h2><ul>
