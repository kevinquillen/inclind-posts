I recently wrote a lengthy case study on Inclind having fused Drupal with Ubercart and Microsoft Dynamics to power the brand new <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Craft Brewery</a> website. It is now a front page feature on <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">drupal.org</a>, our first but hopefully not our last. While I did a majority of the community and content management efficiency improvements for <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head</a>, it was ruff ryder himself Pete Stein who integrated the Microsoft Dynamics behemoth into their commerce system. It was without a doubt one of the biggest projects we have completed here. Blood, sweat, and <del datetime="2009-07-30T18:58:47+00:00">tears</del> beers were spent completing it and we are honored that it is featured on <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">drupal.org</a>. It is the culmination of many hours of teamwork. At the end of July, we also gave a presentation to the Delaware Web Developer group from the <a href="http://www.udel.edu" target="_blank">University of Delaware</a> at the <a href="http://www.wboc.com" target="_blank">WBOC</a> offices in Milton, Delaware. They love the new <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head</a> website and were curious to know how we utilized Drupal to make it come to life. Shaun Tyndall presented it to the group in a 100 minute presentation, with demonstrations and functional walkthrough&#39;s from Pete Stein and Kevin Quillen. When it was over, they were treated to a <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head</a> brewery tour and sampling of some of the <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head</a> brews. Speaking of beer, can someone get our President something better than Bud Light? Just saying!
