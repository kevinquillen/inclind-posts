Inclind has been doing responsive design and responsive websites since early 2011. Along the way we have learned all the ins and outs of working with responsive design and grid frameworks to facilitate it. We&#39;ve tried them all - from Omega, to Twitter Bootstrap, to Blueprint, Base, and Gumby. We settled on Foundation when it was clear that it is the perfect tool for the job. We have embraced it and Zurb&#39;s toolsets and provided solutions for Drupal across the board. <blockquote style="background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #CC0000;"><p style="margin: 0;"><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/business/services.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><strong>Foundation is the first and most advanced responsive, front-end framework in the world.</strong></a> </blockquote>Our diligence and collaboration with the Drupal community has helped us achieve a simultaneous triple release for all major versions of Foundation supporting 3, 4, and now 5, for anyone out there on those platforms. Along with that, we have released modules to work with and enable functionality from all of the plugins in the Zurb Foundation package making things super simple to put a responsive site together fast with slideshows, lightboxed photo galleries, responsive images, and responsive accordion / tab content elements. <h3>Seeing is believing.</h3>Foundation has enabled us to do some of our best work yet with none of the old browser/device hurdles. Look at some of our recent sites. Sexy on any device. <ul><li><a href="http://www.ericksontribune.com/" target="_blank">Erickson Tribune</a></li><li><a href="http://www.baywoodgreens.com/" target="_blank">Baywood Greens</a></li><li><a href="http://www.travelersvoice.org/" target="_blank">U.S. Travel Association: Travelers Voice</a></li><li><a href="http://travelcoalition.org/" target="_blank">U.S. Travel Association: Power of Travel Coalition</a></li><li><a href="http://esto.ustravel.org/" target="_blank">U.S. Travel Association: ESTO</a></li></ul><h3>Go on, empower yourself.</h3>Pick your flavor and hit the ground running.
