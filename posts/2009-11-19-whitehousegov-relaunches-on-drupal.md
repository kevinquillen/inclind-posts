Well ain't that cool. Drupal CMS was chosen to be the base of which the new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov" target="_blank">whitehouse.gov</a> was relaunched on. <em>Earlier this month, the Executive Office of the President of the United States of America relaunched their website, Whitehouse.gov, using Drupal. This week three members of the White House new media team presented at the Washington, DC Drupal users group. New media director Macon Phillips, deputy director of technology David Cole, and creative director Nik Lo Bue talked about their use of Drupal.</em> Â  Watch the screencast here: <a href="http://vimeo.com/7669508" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/7669508</a>
