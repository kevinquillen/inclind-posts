After hanging with Leif and chatting about the crazy blizzard that hit the eastern shore earlier this year, we knew he would be a great addition to our growing team. He jumped at the opportunity to join us and we are glad to have him on board. Leif has a <a href="http://www.leafo.us/" target="_blank">background in photography</a>, web design, SEO, project/client management, and <a href="http://twitter.com/leafophoto">social media</a> with a likeable personality to boot. He&#39;s very active with social media (and we don&#39;t mind that!) such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/leafophoto?ref=sgm" target="_&quot;blank&quot;">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/leafophoto" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. He&#39;s also active in the community with his photography. Welcome Leif!
