Since 1981 <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services</a> has been providing entrepreneurs valuable resources to achieve success in an ever-changing business landscape. HBS has established itself as a leader in the business formation industry and one of the keys to that success is <a href="http://www.inclind.com/cms/drupal-cms.htm">staying current with communication and marketing technologies</a>. As their business expanded <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services</a> identified an international business opportunity and realized the need for a multilingual web presence. Inclind was ready to meet this need by providing them with a Spanish language mirror site of delawarellc.com. Utilizing <a href="http://www.inclind.com/cms/index.htm">Drupal’s powerful translation capabilities</a>, we were able to configure the existing site to recognize a user’s language preferences and present the content in that language. In addition, there is the option for the user to select the language maintaining the flexibility to achieve outstanding usability and accessibility. Please have a look at <a href="http://www.delawarellc.com" target="_blank">delawarellc.com</a> or <a href="http://www.delaware.com/es" target="_blank">delawarellc.com/es</a> en Español to experience the results. <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services</a> has done well by keeping up to date with market trends and technology. The growth of mobile web browsing has exceeded that of desktop surfing. <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services</a> has not ignored that and asked <a href="http://www.inclind.com">Inclind</a> to help them reach those users in a lightweight, mobile friendly way. We were able to offer them a compact solution, which is rich in content with a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and is still <a href="http://www.inclind.com/our-work/index.htm">nice to look at</a>. To do this, we exploited the power of HTML5, CSS3, <a href="http://www.jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://www.jqueryui.com" target="_blank">jQuery UI</a>, <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com" target="_blank">jQuery Mobile</a>, and the new <a href="http://drupal.org/7" target="_blank">Drupal 7 CMS</a>. The user is presented with a responsive layout with stylish buttons paired with thoughtful animations, which reveal and hide information when necessary. The responsive layout adjusts to the users viewing screen so the site is served in a consistent manner no matter how big or small the screen is. We've also configured <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">delawareinc.com</a> to redirect mobile users to the mobile site with automatic device detection. <a href="http://m.delawareinc.com" target="_blank"></a> From the mobile site the user can access information about the services provided by <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services</a>, learn about the types of companies they serve, and view the different service packages they offer. In addition, there is a webform that can be used to inquire about the services and get moving towards forming a business. We were also able to provide a feed of the most recent post from the <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">Harvard Business Services blog</a>. From your mobile device, go to <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" target="_blank">delawareinc.com</a> to experience this delicious awesomesauce. We were very proud to have had the opportunity to make these projects a reality. If you find yourself with similar needs, please <a href="http://www.inclind.com/contact-us.htm">give us a shout</a>. We'll be totally into making your <a href="http://www.inclind.com/cms/drupal-cms.htm">web-standards-compliant / usability / accessibility / mobile-ability</a> dreams come true.
