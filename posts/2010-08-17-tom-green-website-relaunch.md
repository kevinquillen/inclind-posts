Love to laugh? Love good conversation? Love the 'different' side of life? Comedian / entertainer / showbiz revolutionary Tom Green is all of the above, and Inclind has stepped up to assist him in rebuilding his website. Funny man Tom Green has been doing comedy since his teens. A native of Ontario, Canada, Tom has had a love affair with comedy and TV since the 80s. He is best known for his critically acclaimed shows "The Tom Green Show" and "The New Tom Green Show", both on MTV and MTV2, respectively between 1999 and 2004. Tom has also guest hosted "The Late Show with David Letterman", whom he credits with inspiring his style of doing crazy funny things and filming the reactions. He was also one of the first known people to prank his parents on film, before MTVs future shows of "Jackass" and variants like "Punk'd", and some would call it one of the earliest forms of reality tv. Since 2006, Tom has gone independent and now hosts a live internet show from his home in Los Angeles, California. It can be seen on his website nightly, along with previous episodes. Guests include Norm Macdonald, Adam Corolla, Carson Daly, Andrew Dice Clay, Dr. Drew, Val Kilmer, and many many more. Tom has been making us here at Inclind laugh for over a decade! We had a lot of fun working on this and hope you have some laughs as well!
