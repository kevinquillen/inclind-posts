<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Want to apply? <a href="http://smarterer.com/skillsets/join?t=xJOAHrlu" target="_blank">Take the skillset test</a>.  We are hiring and expanding in what is going to be a very busy, creative, and challenging year ahead. If you think you have what it takes, hit us up!  We are looking to hire two people for the position, and possibly a third (as an intern)! We have a lot of design and frontend work scheduled for new and current clients on exciting and challenging projects. Please have chops! :)  Secondly, our funny and ubertalented frontend developer Doug Wallace is leaving us for California. Doug has taken an exciting position as a javascript developer with the social media titan for professionals, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. We'll miss his endless array of stories, jokes, and prowess with CSS, Javascript, and design.  Our culture at Inclind is one that has always attracted and cultivated talented, passionate people who live for the web and possibilities it can bring. If you want to work on fun, exciting and creative projects, from national brands and agencies like <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Craft Brewery</a> and <a href="http://ustravel.org" target="_blank">US Travel Association</a>, to growing businesses like <a href="http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com" target="_blank">Washingtons Green Grocer</a>, or community level projects, we're the place for you. We'd love to hear from you!
