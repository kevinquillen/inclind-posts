The owners of Dos Locos Stonegrill in Rehoboth Beach did a little research on the building that hosts JD&#39;s Filling Station and discovered that it was a fuel station in the 1940&#39;s. Because of this discovery, they set out to fashion the entire Lewes, Delaware restaurant after a gas station, themed to the gills with vintage gas pumps, station attendee uniforms, and even calling the bar a &quot;Parts Counter.&quot; Boasting great food and a great atmosphere, the restaurant is a fun, family-friendly joint in downtown Lewes that is frequented by the breakfast crowd. They have great specials that are updated often, and the staff is friendly. Joe Zuber came to Inclind for this new website design after being pleased with his <a href="/our-work/dos-locos/detail.htm" title="Dos Locos Restaurant - Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Website Design">Dos Locos design</a>. The Dos Locos website matches the front of their very unique storefront, and wanted a similar treatment for this restaurant as well. This website was a joy to build and we look forward to any future web design endeavors with this restauranteur.
