At Inclind, we've always gone above and beyond the call of duty (no, not the worlds most popular video game) to play ball with Internet Explorer 6. It commanded a large part of the market, especially the public sector (schools, offices, government) who&#39;s IT budgets don&#39;t deem this a worthy expense. It also commanded a large part of development time to make certain things work for that browser. It's 2010. It's time to <a href="http://www.stopie6.com/" target="_blank">stop using Internet Explorer 6</a>. Internet Explorer 6 was released like a virus on August 27, 2001 with Windows XP. That makes the browser almost 9 years old. Most of you don&#39;t keep cars for that long. You trust your car to protect you from danger, that it has efficient gas usage and quality parts. As soon as it gets old, or you have service issues, you go get a new car. Yet, some of you don&#39;t seem to be bothered that when you sit down to do your banking or purchase things online, you use a browser that has little to no security, easily delivers malware/virii/spyware, and does not adhere to the internet standards created by some of the top minds of internet architecture at W3C. That's like going 80 miles an hour in a car made of glass, bald tires, and powered by a leaky nuclear core. Eventually you are going to get hurt. With so many super sexy options out there for browsers, you owe it to yourself to upgrade. And why not? Browsers are free. You're lucky. I remember <strong>paying</strong> for Netscape Navigator 4 just to escape Internet Explorer in the 90s. That's how much I loathed it- and that's how popular Netscape used to be. For the stubborn who refuse to upgrade, you are about to be left behind. Companies like Google are <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/02/ie6-users-to-be-evicted-from-gmail-google-calendar.ars" target="_blank">discontinuing support for Internet Explorer 6</a>. Google knows whats up. It's time for you to take action. Please upgrade your browser today. Choose a flavor and enjoy better, and safer, internet browsing today. All of these browsers offer bookmark importing, so you can take your favorites from IE with you. <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a></strong> If you need assistance upgrading, we're here to help.
