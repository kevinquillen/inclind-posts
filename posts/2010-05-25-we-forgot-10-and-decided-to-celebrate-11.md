We decided to take a moment and have some fine 90 Minute IPA courtesy of <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Craft Brewery</a> and reflect upon the last 11 years of operation. First, we&#39;d like to thank our <a href="/our-work/index.htm" target="_blank">loyal customers</a> for continued business and success over the years. We would not be here without you. Secondly, we decided to celebrate by <a href="http://www.inclind.com">redeveloping our website</a>&nbsp;using the crazy awesome Drupal platform and utilizing some new HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and other cool geeky goodness. We are happy to have made it this far and have lots of good things to look forward to in our future. Salut!
