<a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank">Delaware Electric Cooperative</a> came to us looking to revitalize their website and give it that spark that it was missing. They came to <a href="http://www.inclind.com/our-work/index.htm" title="Inclind Inc - True Delaware Web Developers.">Inclind</a> to help them achieve that goal. Our <a href="http://www.inclind.com/about/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Inclind Inc - Real Delaware Web Design.">graphic design team duo</a>&nbsp;Bryan Selders &amp; Doug Wallace went to town creating an eye catching and engaging responsive design that scaled down to work for customers on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices. Responsive design is very critical component to web design in 2012 and beyond, and is the fourth website we have done with this technique with more in the pipeline. Not sure what responsive design is?
