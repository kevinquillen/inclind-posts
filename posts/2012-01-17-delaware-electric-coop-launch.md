<a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank">Delaware Electric Cooperative</a> came to us looking to revitalize their website and give it that spark that it was missing. They came to <a href="http://www.inclind.com/our-work/index.htm" title="Inclind Inc - True Delaware Web Developers.">Inclind</a> to help them achieve that goal.  Our <a href="http://www.inclind.com/about/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Inclind Inc - Real Delaware Web Design.">graphic design team duo</a> Bryan Selders &amp; Doug Wallace went to town creating an eye catching and engaging responsive design that scaled down to work for customers on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.  Responsive design is very critical component to web design in 2012 and beyond, and is the fourth website we have done with this technique with more in the pipeline. Not sure what responsive design is? Check out a previous post by Doug Wallace: <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/web-design/drupal-responsive-design-with-the-omega-html5-base-theme/detail.htm" target="_blank">Drupal &amp; Responsive Design</a>.  <a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank"></a>  The <a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank">Delaware Electric Cooperative</a> website was designed to work on all devices so customers would be 'plugged in' and be able to stay up to date on company news, power outages, and read advisory notices. They can also order services and lights as well. <a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank">Delaware Electric Cooperative</a> has the ability to put out <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank" title="Inclind Inc - Custom Drupal Module Development">User Alerts</a>, a custom Drupal module we built in-house, when critical information is available such as power outage or service updates that need to be presented to users immediately.  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank"></a>  (a sample <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank">User Alert</a> set on the website)  Users can also interact with <a href="http://www.delaware.coop" target="_blank">Delaware Electric Cooperative</a> through their social media accounts on Facebook &amp; Twitter, keeping them in close contact with their customers on different mediums.
