Pot-Nets is a collection of waterfront communities located in Sussex County, Delaware. They have all different types of vacation and retirement style homes at affordable prices. These communities make it possible to afford the dream life. The communities are managed the Tunnel Corporation which have been in business for decades, and say that "the private, relaxed, secure neighborhoods, the resort quality of life, the tax-free outlets and antique shopping, historic landmarks in Lewes and Rehoboth Beach with close proximity to the Atlantic have families returning year after year."
