Sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ustravel.org" target="_blank">US Travel Association</a>, <a href="http://www.inclind.com" target="_blank">Inclind</a> developed a custom Drupal module to allow them to &#39;alert&#39; visitors to important information, inspired by CNN Breaking News functionality. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank">User Alert module</a> uses cookies to track a user, so the feature works well for anonymous visitors as well as authenticated by tracking the cookie instead of the user ID. <p class="rtecenter"> <img alt="" height="106" src="/sites/default/files/breaking-news_1.preview.jpg" width="600" /> The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank">User Alert module</a> has been approved, packaged, and released on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank">drupal.org</a>. There are a handful of features for it, such as controlling the length of time an alert displays for, template and CSS override capability, and ability to change the label from &#39;User Alert&#39; to &#39;Breaking News&#39;, or whatever you prefer. This is a handy module for news websites, political websites, commerce websites, or community websites. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_alert" target="_blank">Check it out!</a>
