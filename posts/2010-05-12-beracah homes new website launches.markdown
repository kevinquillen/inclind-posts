<a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank">Beracah Homes</a>, a Delmarva based stick built home construction company, has launched their brand new site today. Their previous system was a large Drupal 5 application managing 7 websites which we built in 2008 (and was one of our first Drupal websites). Inclind redeveloped <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank">beracahhomes.com</a> under their custom Drupal 6 package, providing added functionality, a better administrative user interface, content delivery through XML services, billboard (rotating banners) management, and high quality video encoding capabilities. Leif Osmundson provided Beracah Homes with a new design for a fresh look and feel for the upcoming years. We&#39;ve also implemented better search engine optimization tools to help Beracah Homes rank better amongst their competitors. <strong>Before:</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="448" src="/sites/default/files/images/beracah-old.jpg" title="beracah-old" width="550" /></a> <strong>After:</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="448" src="/sites/default/files/images/beracah-new.jpg" title="beracah-new" width="550" /></a> <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank">Beracah Homes&#39;</a> builders also have a Drupal package allowing them to manage their own website while receiving modular homes content from <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank">beracahhomes.com</a>. The builders now have the flexibility of customizing their CMS to their needs without being conformed to the same system tie-in they previously had. It was difficult before to add functionality to one site without affecting the rest, but now all sites can scale without an issue. Services XML, similar to our Drupal RETS implementation for Drupal real estate, allows Roger Collison (Vice President of <a href="http://www.beracahhomes.com" target="_blank">Beracah Homes</a>) to enter model home types, home specifications, floorplans and photos. That content is then sent to all builder sites so everyone has the same information without having to manage it themselves. This ensures that information on all the homes Beracah builds is accurate and up to date across all their websites without a salesperson in another branch having to remember to make the changes. This was a major functionality change that allowed us to decouple all the websites from a single application, providing them with the same content delivery feature while giving them room to manage their own site.
