Their new Delaware Real Estate section is powered by our Drupal stack utilizing a custom in-house RETS module. Previous systems would receive listings once a day through a bulk FTP push from Offutt. Using RETS, <a href="http://www.wilgusassociates.com/" target="_blank" title="Wilgus Associates - Delaware Real Estate">Wilgus Associates</a> can receive on-demand updates and data every hour. This allows for the data to be arranged, mapped, sorted and listed in thousands of ways backed up by hourly data integrity functions to ensure the most up to date information, not to mention the worlds most flexible CMS to manage content with Drupal. The new site also makes use of extensive search engine optimization work to help Wilgus rank better amongst their competiton. It also utilizes social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook to help spread the word and allow users to share/bookmark listings in their respective services. <h2> What is RETS?</h2> The Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS) facilitates data transfer between partners in the real estate industry. Creating and improving RETS is a collaborative effort to simplify moving real estate information from system to system and simplify solution development efforts. As RETS usage matures and expands, MLS with geographic overlaps can create data-sharing policies that provide their members a single point of entry to search multiple MLS data sets. <h2> Interested in RETS?</h2> If you're a broker or REALTOR, using RETS technology is the fastest way to get listings up and running on your website. Our RETS system for Drupal was built with flexibility, speed, marketing, and conversions in mind allowing us to quickly and effectively deploy it in no time.
