<h3>Awesomesauce Drupal Websites</h3> We've made a lot of mention in the last week about all the <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/development/washingtons-green-grocers-yummy-new-product-catalog/detail.htm" target="_blank">awesome things we've done for Washingtons Green Grocer</a>, there are many other sites we're doing awesome things with as well!  <a href="http://www.historiclewes.org" target="_blank">Historic Lewes</a> saw a full redesign, data migration, and relaunch. Over 20,000 pieces of content were created from an old fragmented CakePHP application, cleaned up &amp; normalized. Visitors can now see tons of artifacts, graves, and historical buildings on the website with all the information on record as well as view their respective locations via Google Maps, get information on tours, and purchase things in their online ecommerce store. Shaun also gave a presentation on the website and Drupal to the Small Museum Association in Feburary.  <a href="http://www.bethany-fenwick.org/" target="_blank">Bethany Fenwick Chamber of Commerce</a> was redesigned and migrated from our legacy Inclind CMS system into Drupal. Content was restructured for super efficient SEO performance and user navigation, and backend integration with WebLink allows for targeted advertising and system searching. Members also have online payment options, and users can <a href="http://web.bethany-fenwick.org/search" target="_blank">browse a full business directory</a> with ease.  <a href="http://www.downtownrehoboth.com" target="_blank">Downtown Rehoboth</a> was also migrated from our legacy Inclind CMS system into Drupal. Like Bethany Fenwick Chamber of Commerce, they also have <a href="http://www.downtownrehoboth.com/supporters/shop" target="_blank">an online business directory</a> where <a href="http://www.downtownrehoboth.com/suppporters/dogfish-head-brewings-eats.htm" target="_blank">businesses can 'take control' over their listing</a> and manage the content themselves.  <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/development/washingtons-green-grocers-yummy-new-product-catalog/detail.htm">Washington's Green Grocer</a> was upgraded with a new content architecture on the frontend, giving way to a full product catalog, Farms directory, blog posts and recipes all being linked for circular navigation. On the first day of launch, <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/development/washingtons-green-grocers-yummy-new-product-catalog/detail.htm">Washington's Green Grocer</a> saw 20,000 increase in page views, with an average of 5,000 extra page views a day. In addition to these changes, we implemented a full search backend with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">ApacheSolr</a>, increasing site search performnace by 60%, and reducing the size of their database by 700 MB, increasing overall app performance. That's a lot of content indexed!   <a href="http://sussex.lib.de.us/" target="_blank">Sussex Libraries</a> website launched on top of Drupal 7 responsive design, so the site is accessible from desktop browsers, tablets, and phones. Content was categorized and linked for SEO performance, and mapping of libraries in Sussex County was achieved with OpenLayers.  <a href="http://www.betsycasting.com/" target="_blank">Betsy Royall Casting Agency</a> received the full Inclind treatment, with a custom design and branding by our talented lead designer Bryan Selders, with full content management system training carried out by he and Nancy Jones.  We also launched a brand new website for the <a href="http://www.nanticokeseniorcenter.com/" target="_blank">Nanticoke Senior Center</a>, complete with community event calendar, photo galleries, online payment forms and blogs. <h3>Drupalcon Denver 2012</h3> Drupalcon Denver was a huge success and one of the best Drupalcon conferences yet. We had a lot of fun exploring Denver, taking in sessions from web development professionals, and meeting with people from all over the globe working on all sorts of great projects. We especially enjoyed the private breakfast with Dries and Angie Byron, leaders of the Drupal project and Acquia, representatives from the Veterans Association and University of Nebraska. We'd also like to thank Bryan House and team from Acquia for their hospitality, drinks, and excellent discussions about beer and technology. We're looking forward to Drupalcon Portland 2013! <h3>Office Collaboration Spaces</h3> As some of our clients have already noticed, we've configured our entire office to be a completely open and collaborative space. Instead of individual offices and a conference room, each room in the office now supports multiple people, effectively making each room its own conference space. We still have some areas open for individual workspaces, for when our programmers need some deep thought coding sessions. We've seen an immediate increase in productivity and collaboration, new ideas and problem solving occur in the first week of this change.  There is so much more we'd like to talk about, but we can't just yet! It's shaping up to be an exciting year as we push onward with cool projects for existing and new clients, as well as some extra things we will be announcing soon.
