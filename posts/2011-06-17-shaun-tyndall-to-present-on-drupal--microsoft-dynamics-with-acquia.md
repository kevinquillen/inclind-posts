Shaun Tyndall will be presenting on the integration we did for <a href="http://www.dogfish.com" target="_blank">Dogfish Head Craft Brewery</a> with Microsoft Dynamics on July 13th. Over the years, we have had the pleasure of working on lots of cool projects for Dogfish Head from design to full on websites. One of our most recognized (and challenging) projects was integrating Microsoft Great Plains / Dynamics platform with Drupal, one of the worlds top content management systems, to power the websites ecommerce front-end, the point of sale backend, send/receive data to Great Plains, as well as do custom order and sales reporting. We have been asked by <a href="http://acquia.com/" target="_blank">Acquia</a>&nbsp;to take part in a special presentation about <a href="http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/drupal-and-microsoft-dynamics-crm-integration" target="_blank">Drupal and Microsoft Dynamics</a>. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery is a brewing company based in Milton, Delaware. The brewery is prominently featured in the Discovery channel series Brew Masters, is one of the top 20 microbreweries in North America, and thousands of people visit their brewery for tours each year. Their online store as well as their point of sale terminals in the brewery are powered by Drupal with data controlled entirely from Microsoft Dynamics, requiring little to no human management of products on the Drupal side. In the webinar the developers will discuss how to integrate Microsoft Dynamics with Drupal to power their Ubercart commerce system from Great Plains controlled product database, send Ubercart orders back to Great Plains as invoices (Documents), receive products from Great Plains and create attributes/options from SKUs, create role based pricing mapped to Great Plains product price levels, and sync Drupal/Ubercart data with the Great Plains backend. <a href="http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/drupal-and-microsoft-dynamics-crm-integration" target="_blank">For more information on the webinar, visit the Acquia website</a>.
