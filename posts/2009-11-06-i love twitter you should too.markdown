<a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> connects everyday people to others they normally would never have contact with. Celebrities, for example, or high profile folks in general, you would have to go through a fan club or agent, through publicists, etc before you could even think of communicating to someone. A few days ago, I took 10 seconds to fire off a question to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack" target="_blank">John Carmack</a> of <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com" target="_blank">iD Software</a>, who basically INVENTED modern gaming as we know it, over <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This guy is solely responsible for gaming today. He created Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, and Quake (not to mention causing me to log hours and hours of gametime) and spawned countless games in their wake like Half-Life. <a href="http://bethblog.com/index.php/2009/11/05/john-carmack-on-doom-classic-development-fan-questions/" target="_blank">http://bethblog.com/index.php/2009/11/05/john-carmack-on-doom-classic-development-fan-questions/</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack" target="_blank">John Carmack</a>, the legendary godfather of gaming answered my question from <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I guess I ought to put <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/11/03/doom-classic-released-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/" target="_blank">Doom on my iPhone</a> now, or at least die happy. I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to connect with industry leaders, celebrities, and everyday people.
