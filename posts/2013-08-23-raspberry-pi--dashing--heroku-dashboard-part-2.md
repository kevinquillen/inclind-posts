<p dir="ltr">If you&#39;re following along the dashboard series you should have your Raspberry Pi fully configured by the instructions in the <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/development/raspberry-pi-dashingjs-heroku-dashboard-part-1/detail.htm">previous post</a>. This post will discuss setting up the Dashing repository on your local computer and finish with a simple Heroku hosting solution. <p dir="ltr">I highly recommend navigating through the project page prior to working with any code. The purpose is to become familiar with the structure and organization of the Dashing framework. Do not be alarmed as you need not to be a Rubyist or have familiarity with the Ruby programming language to complete this setup. <p dir="ltr">One of the really cool abilities of the Dashing framework is the ability to pull data from external API&rsquo;s and display the data in any format. Examples of this are available for use <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets">here</a>. You may notice Kevin Quillen, Inclind Senior Developer and Architect, was able to implement a Reddit widget one evening after supper. <p dir="ltr">The core project structure is: <ul dir="ltr"><li>assets/ (<em>css/js/fonts/images</em>)</li><li>jobs/ (<em>your logic for making http/https requests and transforming any API data</em>)</li><li>dashboard/ (<em>layout templates in .erb</em>)</li><li>widgets/ (<em>individual widgets composed of Coffescript, Sass, and HTML</em>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The framework also includes many libraries that implement the latest HTML5 web standards. Most notably would be <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbatmanjs.org%2F&amp;ei=A4ETUvi-EcWy4AOeuoH4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyF-AR8lyocoyWRuNPax31oXnFwg&amp;bvm=bv.50952593,d.dmg" target="_blank">Batman.js</a>. To begin working with your code base it is assumed that Ruby gem installation can be facilitated on your local computer. If not you will need to start here <a href="http://rubygems.org/">http://rubygems.org/</a>. If you want to analyze and debug the code on your local computer you can check out this related post, <a href="http://www.inclind.com/journal/development/rubymine-debugging-and-development/detail.htm">Debugging Rubymine</a>, to see how we configured RubyMine to debug our Dashing project. <p dir="ltr">After running the following commands, you should have a simple dashboard available for viewing in your web browser. (Note: &lt;name_of_project&gt; should be replaced by the name of your project) <ul dir="ltr"><li>gem install dashing</li><li>dashing new &lt;name_of_project&gt;</li><li>cd &lt;name_of_project&gt;</li><li>bundle</li><li>dashing start</li><li>Control-t (opens a new tab in OSX)</li><li>open &quot;<a href="http://localhost:3030/public">http://localhost:3030/sample</a>&quot;</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Hopefully its this simple for you! <p dir="ltr">Now that you have a local copy of the Dashing project the two common options are to either use the Raspberry Pi as your server or host it on Heroku. For those not familiar, Heroku is a flexible hosting solution that can accommodate the Dashing framework dependencies. Not to mention free for limited use! <p dir="ltr"><strong>Option 1</strong> is much more difficult to implement. You will need to configure the Raspberry Pi with many tools in order for it to run. The Inclind project team collectively decided against this option. Caveats in speed and performance being the main criterion. If your interested in this solution you may look to this post <a href="https://gist.github.com/stonehippo/5896381">https://gist.github.com/stonehippo/5896381</a> (untested) for better direction. <p dir="ltr"><strong>Option 2</strong> is the most common. You&rsquo;ll need to go to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">https://www.heroku.com/</a> and register for a free account in order for this to work. Upon setting up an account on Heroku you will need to add your SSH credentials to the account. If your unfamiliar with this proccess you may find it helpful to visit the resource at&nbsp;<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys</a> for more thorough information. Once you have setup your computer to communicate with the Heroku server you&#39;ll be free to deploy your Dashboard app on the world wide web! <p dir="ltr">These public Github repositories may assist you in deploying your project onto the Heroku platform using just your Terminal application. <ul dir="ltr"><li><a href="https://github.com/DevelopStuff/dashing-freshbooks">https://github.com/DevelopStuff/dashing-freshbooks</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to%3A-Deploy-to-Heroku">https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to%3A-Deploy-to-Heroku</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/bassdread/debonair">https://github.com/bassdread/debonair</a></li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div>
