We are excited to be heading out to <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupalcon</a> for our second trip! The team is heading to Chicago for a week of developer seminars, design/theming workshops, API workshops, and lots of sightseeing. Trey Bowden from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery will also be attending!   We learned a lot last time and are looking forward to honing our Drupal 7 chops from now to March. Inclind takes continuing education seriously because <strong>great web development is our passion</strong>.   Drupal is everywhere in 2011! See you there!
