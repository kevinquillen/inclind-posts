287,Inclind Launches New Prudential Gallo Real Estate Management Intranet,2007-10-02,"<p>	On September 28th, 2007, the Inclind team launched a brand new version of the Prudential Gallo Intranet. Prudential Gallo is a Delaware real estate company with two offices, one in Lewes, Delaware, and the other in and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. They have approximately 90 agents employed and are one of the top sales leaders in Sussex County, and one of our oldest clients. Now they have the best real estate management system and company intranet they can&#39;t get anywhere else. Combining three of our big products, Inclind Intranet, Inclind CMS (Content Management System) and Inclind Real Estate, Prudential Gallo&#39;s new intranet is going to make them more efficient, productive, and successful than ever before.</p><p>	Prudential Gallo agents can use the intranet to do the following:</p><ul>	<li>		Check for new Delaware MLS real estate listings from Offutt</li>	<li>		Manage their contacts and real estate leads</li>	<li>		Manage development communities they are assigned to</li>	<li>		Add additional documents for a listing</li>	<li>		Add additional data for a listing, such as longer description, links, or supplied information from the seller</li>	<li>		Manage events, such as an Open House</li>	<li>		Manage their mailing list</li>	<li>		Send email to contacts or leads</li>	<li>		Manage their agent profile, viewable on the website</li>	<li>		Manage internal documents</li>	<li>		Manage advertisements</li>	<li>		Generate reports based on listing data and export data to excel for further drill down reporting</li>	<li>		Generate datasheets to Microsoft Word documents for printing and editing</li>	<li>		Manage rentals from an external XML feed</li></ul><p>	Prudential Gallo staff members can use the intranet to do the following:</p><ul>	<li>		Manage and assign leads to an agent</li>	<li>		Create and manage content across any Prudential Gallo website</li>	<li>		Send company-wide email, or send email to Prudential Gallo contacts</li>	<li>		Manage internal and public news</li>	<li>		Manage Virtual Tours</li></ul><p>	These are only some of the great features deployed for Prudential Gallo. It is one of our most versatile web applications yet. Nearly everything, aside from the dynamic code logic, is manageble by Prudential Gallo, allowing them to be as hands-on as they want to be. As lead developer on the project, I was tasked with approaching the application from both a programmer, web developer, and user&#39;s perspective. I had to put myself in the shoes of the agent and wonder to myself &quot;What would I want to see here?&quot; or &quot;How would I use this?&quot;. Doing so helped us design an even tighter interface on the intranet usability and improved the visual aesthetics, which the client and agents had commented on. They find their new intranet is fantastic and a breath of fresh air, a major and much needed improvement over their old one which was supplied by a previous vendor. It is completely platform independent and is accessible from any OS with a web browser. I enjoyed working on this project a lot and look forward to working on more like this in the future. I was able to learn more about programming and product integration as well as improving/enhancing user interface.

327,Dogfish Head Brewery Site Launches; Team Heads to Washington DC,2009-03-04,"<p>	On March 3rd, 2009, Inclind Inc launched the brand new front and back end for <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head Brewery</a>. It&#39;s almost a year to the day that Inclind began planning the new <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> website and the features it would include in the first phase of the launch. The end result is a culmination of a years worth of blood, sweat, pizza and tears of hard work and dedication. Their new site has everything they have been wanting and more. <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> can now easily manage their 800 page (and growing!) website, all its users, media, newsletters, news articles, events, RSS feeds, and comments. They can add/remove &#39;locations&#39; of where their product is sold, served, or distributed. This allows customers to log in and see where they can find Dogfish on the &#39;<a href=""http://www.dogfish.com/community/fish-findin.htm"" target=""_blank"">Fish Finder</a>&#39;. Try it out! With that, the new site features a fully functioning community section and social network. Users can register on the website for an account, after which they can create a basic profile. From there, they have access to submit a map location to their Fish Finder, add or comment on threads in the Forum, submit questions to Dogfish staff in Ask Dogfish, comment on Dogfish staff blogs (Blogfish), and connect with other Dogfish loving fans. All applicable content is able to be sent instantly through Twitter/Digg/MySpace/Facebook/etc in a single click of the &#39;Share&#39; button. We really went all out to flesh out the community side and give users stuff to do in between staff blogs and answering questions. Our new system that was used on <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head Brewery</a> has no official name yet, or I&#39;d tell you what it is ha. We hope to have that nailed down soon. What I can tell you is that its the most feature complete, stable and scalable CMS you are going to find on the east coast. I would put it up against anything the competition has to offer from Maine to Florida with confidence ours is as on par or better than what else is available. Since the code is modular, its not coded for 1 strict specific project (as we used to) but rather, any client who comes in the door can have the same power, accessibility, UI and functionality of big time folk like Dogfish. In other words, it makes our platform highly scalable and consistent. All ya gotta do is <a href=""http://www.inclind.com/contact.htm"">ask us</a>. As for the rest of the week, Pete, Trey and Kevin are representing Inclind at DrupalCon in Washington DC. They will be talking to fellow developers and programmers and sharing / showing off work.

344,Dogfish Head Site Featured on Drupal.org,2009-08-04,"<p>	I recently wrote a lengthy case study on Inclind having fused Drupal with Ubercart and Microsoft Dynamics to power the brand new <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head Craft Brewery</a> website. It is now a front page feature on <a href=""http://www.drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">drupal.org</a>, our first but hopefully not our last. While I did a majority of the community and content management efficiency improvements for <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head</a>, it was ruff ryder himself Pete Stein who integrated the Microsoft Dynamics behemoth into their commerce system. It was without a doubt one of the biggest projects we have completed here.

At the end of July, we also gave a presentation to the Delaware Web Developer group from the <a href=""http://www.udel.edu"" target=""_blank"">University of Delaware</a> at the <a href=""http://www.wboc.com"" target=""_blank"">WBOC</a> offices in Milton, Delaware. They love the new <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head</a> website and were curious to know how we utilized Drupal to make it come to life. Shaun Tyndall presented it to the group in a 100 minute presentation, with demonstrations and functional walkthrough&#39;s from Pete Stein and Kevin Quillen. When it was over, they were treated to a <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head</a> brewery tour and sampling of some of the <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head</a> brews.</p><p>	Speaking of beer, can someone get our President something better than Bud Light?

351,Billboard Management Now Available,2009-10-30,"<p>	Billboards (renamed from 'Banners') is a brand new feature we have been rolling out in the last week for clients with very positive feedback. It is a self-contained Drupal module we built that requires only Imagecache. There are no real modules to facilitate managing header area images, other than HeaderImage and Ads. HeaderImage is 'okay' but becomes too cumbersome from adding block after block, and Ads is entirely too beastly to achieve a simple implementation.<p>Previously, it took knowledge of image gallery, taxonomy, blocks, images and paths to tie everything together to get a banner to appear. Even some of the more popular modules require you to create a View per banner. That is way too much to ask a client to do who is busy trying to run a successful business.</p><p>What are billboards (banners, header images, et al) you ask? Billboards are the large images you see on various websites that cover the header area. They typically contain marketing statements and imagery relevant to the websites purpose or page content. Here are is one of my favorite examples: <a href=""http://www.visitsoutherndelaware.com/"" target=""_blank"">Visit Southern Delaware Tourism Website</a> See that set of images just above the content, fading in and out? That is a billboard.</p><p>With this module, you can create those in a matter of seconds. After some brainstorming between Shaun and myself, we set out to create something simple, as simple as creating a Page node, without all the aforementioned hassle. After a week of coding, testing, testing and testing, we achieved just that. Now all you have to do is say, I want to create a Billboard, drop in your images (with a cool AJAX in-place uploader, you don't even have to leave the page), and tell it what pages to display on and you're done! It couldn't be any simpler. You also have additional options available to you such as changing how the images display (random image, or fade in/out between images), setting ALT and Title tags for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and select a resize option to size the billboard to (which is controlled and hooked into ImageCache!). Oh, on top of all of that, it's all output via a single block. That's right, you can have 100 billboards and just one block. Once you place it in the region, depending on your site theme, it's ready to go.</p><p>We're here to serve you, to help you get things done faster, and make it so you don&#39;t need a PHd to manage your site. If you have any questions regarding Billboards, Drupal, our refined CMS package or need help managing your content, we are here to help.

360,"Choose Drupal, Not Proprietary",2010-01-02,"<p>	Near the end of 2008, Shaun and I sat down and made the collective decision to change direction in how we develop solutions for clients. It was becoming more obvious as the economy started going downhill, we needed to find a way to decrease development costs and increase efficiency to stay relevant. To do this, we knew we had to find a way to get things done faster and to stop reinventing the wheel. Up to that point, we had done every project in Coldfusion hosted on Windows (and eventually Linux). There is a price tag that came with that though, whether it be hosting, Coldfusion licensing/upgrading, or development costs.</p><p>	As people were let go due to the economy, we also realized that it is difficult to support proprietary code for a proprietary solution someone else wrote. Why? Because that person is <strong>the only person</strong> in the world who knows why they made the application/code that way. When something goes wrong, you spend hours trying to find the issue, and even more time coming up with a tested reliable solution. Proprietary solutions are sold as the best thing since sliced bread, but what customers don&#39;t know is that they are getting locked in to that company. You can&#39;t easily cut ties with a firm and take your site someplace else.</p><p>	Proprietary applications are the brainchild of whoever developed it. Therefore, when you need support, you won&#39;t get it. That developer is long gone, but you are stuck with their code. These firms put you in a box and want to keep you there- that is the whole point of proprietary systems. Why do you think you can&#39;t install OSX on a PC? Why do you think video games are built only for Windows, and not Linux or Mac? It&#39;s all about client retention for them.</p><p>	With that, we decided to start fresh and drop our proprietary Coldfusion CMS and Ecommerce platforms. Everyday we were tied up in fixing Inclind Commerce, or trying to meet the needs of each client for Inclind CMS. Pete and I went as fast as we could, but we pretty much knew there was no way to compete with the rest of the world. We turned to open source solutions to provide us a solid base to build off of, instead of starting each project from scratch (which all essentially had the same core functionality as it were). Developing Coldfusion in Fusebox framework is/was an absolute nightmare and probably still is. It is a disjointed unauthentic implementation of MVC style framework despite what they say, and requires you to hold its hand every step of the development process. We knew Wordpress would not be a solution at all. At best, it is a blogging platform and nothing more. You may read lots of articles that say how awesome Wordpress is and is a CMS, but <strong>it is not a CMS</strong>. You&#39;ll also see that those articles are written by designers too, not developers. It&#39;s a pain in the ass to develop for, it has patches every other week, plugins are prone to XSS attacks or theme hacking, and cannot sustain the level of development we perform. It is not a prime-time application for websites. We also tried Joomla. Knowing it was based around Mambo, my expectations were low for it based on the experience I had working with Mambo. Even 5 years later, it had an ugly backend, scattered developer community, and little support. The developer area is full of confusing rules, practices and jargon. Take this for example, from the Joomla extensions page:</p><ul>	<li>		Component - Mini-application to render the main page body.</li>	<li>		Module - Renders small html blocks on any page.</li>	<li>		Plugin - Changes code behavior dynamically.</li>	<li>		Language - Provides language translation.</li>	<li>		Ext. Specific Addon - Specific addon that requires another ext. to operate.</li>	<li>		Tool - External application that helps with creating or managing Joomla! site.</li></ul><p>	What the hell is the difference? All 6 bullet points say the same thing, yet they are 6 different kinds of extensions for Joomla. We couldn&#39;t see ourselves training clients around the confusing backend or having lowered development time with their overly complicated extension system and scary licensing rules. We came to Drupal. I had heard about this one on and off in various circles, generally more good than bad. After a week of successful proof of concepts for different kinds of websites, we decided Drupal was the best solution for us in terms of what we needed to accomplish. Out of the box, Drupal provides:</p><ul>	<li>		Database abstraction</li>	<li>		Auto-discovery of custom modules</li>	<li>		Managed workflow</li>	<li>		Robust Development API</li>	<li>		Experienced and organized developer community</li>	<li>		Intuitive administrative backend</li>	<li>		Easy integration of custom modules through the hook system</li></ul><p>	There is a solution for just about any scenario in the Drupal world. They have a very good approval process for modules. For example, if a module has security loopholes or bad coding practices, it will not be accepted until those are corrected (I don&#39;t see this happening in other projects). If someone is trying to submit a module that already exists in some form, they are encouraged to merge efforts so the community isn&#39;t littered with duplicate modules with the same functionality. It is differences like these that make Drupal the most widely used, highly regarded, best open source CMS bar none. Our choice was the right one, proving vital in our relevance to custom web development and is a reason why we are still here and still the top choice for web design / web development / website building on the peninsula. We are able to deploy websites with a consistent codebase and backend in rapid succession. Clients are pleased with the added functionality and easier administrative UI. We&#39;re at the point now where we can take Drupal and make it do anything we need it to do, big or small. We&#39;ve been able to provide scalable solutions from the collaboration of many people providing a solid product. Instead of a couple of people making an in-house solution, we&#39;re working with hundreds on a more polished result. We changed our entire development process so we could have a streamlined workflow and tighter communication between ourselves and the client with great results.</p><p>	We have some pretty cool projects in the pipeline for 2010 utilizing Drupal and hope to have some things to show off in the next few months. iPhones, region-free real estate integration, content distribution, big boy stuff.

362,Keep Passwords Safe with Keepass and GoodPassword,2010-01-07,"<p>	Working with websites, content management systems, and secure data, you get to see your fair share of passwords. Over the years we have educated customers about why their passwords need to be better than 'password' or 'bill' and should be hard to guess. Using a service like <a href=""http://www.goodpassword.com"" target=""_blank"">GoodPassword</a> will help you generate a more secure password with random letters, case, numbers, and symbols. Of course, its not going to generate the kind of password you will be able to remember (which is a good thing). Some online services like Twitter have <a href=""http://www.gaj-it.com/14253/twitter-bans-370-passwords-too-easy-to-hack/"" target=""_blank"">taken measures to prevent users from creating passwords that are too common or not secure</a>. Fortunately, there is a program out there that will help you keep track of your passwords in a secure way. <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> is a free program for Windows, Linux, iPhone, and OSX and other portable devices. <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> allows you to store login information for reference. For example, if you have an Amazon account and you go to log into the website, you can open <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> and grab your password to paste into the login form at Amazon.</p><p class=""rtecenter"">	<img alt="""" class=""aligncenter"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/main_big.png"" title=""Keepass"" width=""550"" /></p><p>	<a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> keeps your data in an encrypted database that must be opened with a master password. Think of it like the key to your front door. This is the only password you need to remember, because it will prevent you from getting to your data if you cannot remember it (just like losing your key to the house will have you locked out). The best way I have found to use <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> is to install the software on the machines you frequently use, and store your <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> database on a USB stick for safekeeping. That way, you can access your passwords anywhere you are, so long as <a href=""http://keepass.info"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a> software is installed. If you do a lot of commerce online, it would be a good idea to look into this solution for yourself. Better safe than sorry!</p>", Security

An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.</em></p><p>	<a href=""http://www.delawarellc.com"" target=""_blank"">Delaware LLC</a> is built on our custom Drupal CMS package. It was designed from the ground up by Creative Director Kevin Howett, and put together in a collaborative effort between newcomer Matt Oseland, Kevin Howett and Bryan Cordrey. Efforts were focused on a pleasing, business-minded design, effective search engine optimization, and funneling/encouraging customers to begin the process of <a href=""http://www.delawarellc.com"" target=""_blank"">forming an LLC in Delaware</a>. As Rick&#39;s customers go to him and Harvard Business Services for their LLC/incorporation expertise, Rick came to <a href=""http://www.inclind.com"" target=""_blank"">Inclind</a> for our expertise in clean, effective websites and powerful web application development under Drupal and our deep knowledge of content management systems such as Drupal. We also got to flex our system integration skills with Drupal, PHP and Coldfusion.</p><h3>	About Delaware LLC &amp; Harvard Business Services</h3><p>	With more than 25 years of experience, over 20,000 clients worldwide, and offices in both the United States and Europe, Harvard Business Services, Inc. is the premier provider of registered agent and business formation solutions. Rick Bell formed Harvard Business Services, Inc. in March, 1981. Competitors then were big and well established. But Rick conducted business with a philosophy that allowed Harvard not just to survive but to thrive, emerging over time to become an acknowledged leader in the business formation industry. His philosophy focused on a highly personalized style of customer service, understanding that beyond the mechanics of forming a business there were dreams and aspirations. A customer&#39;s individual questions and concerns were important and special, and that&#39;s how they were treated. Rick also decided that a customer&#39;s business formation costs should be fixed, predictable, affordable, and customers should get a lot of value for their money. After almost 30 years and tens of thousands of business formations later, that same approach is still the signature of our culture and way of doing business: speed, efficiency, expertise and affordability, all delivered with the Harvard legacy of personal service. Headquartered in Lewes, DE, Harvard Business Services, Inc. today is the leading provider of business formation services. Along with the Harvard Business Services brand of fast, personalized service, customers soon discover a number of other traits that set Harvard Business Services, Inc. far apart from the rest.</p><p>	If you have any questions regarding content management systems, Drupal, Coldfusion or systems integration, we are here to help.

366,"New Year, New Browser.",2010-02-04,"<p>	At Inclind, we've always gone above and beyond the call of duty (no, not the worlds most popular video game) to play ball with Internet Explorer 6. It commanded a large part of the market, especially the public sector (schools, offices, government) who&#39;s IT budgets don&#39;t deem this a worthy expense. It also commanded a large part of development time to make certain things work for that browser.</p><p>	It's 2010. It's time to <a href=""http://www.stopie6.com/"" target=""_blank"">stop using Internet Explorer 6</a>. Internet Explorer 6 was released like a virus on August 27, 2001 with Windows XP. That makes the browser almost 9 years old. Most of you don&#39;t keep cars for that long. You trust your car to protect you from danger, that it has efficient gas usage and quality parts. As soon as it gets old, or you have service issues, you go get a new car. Yet, some of you don&#39;t seem to be bothered that when you sit down to do your banking or purchase things online, you use a browser that has little to no security, easily delivers malware/virii/spyware, and does not adhere to the internet standards created by some of the top minds of internet architecture at W3C. That's like going 80 miles an hour in a car made of glass, bald tires, and powered by a leaky nuclear core. Eventually you are going to get hurt.</p><p>	With so many super sexy options out there for browsers, you owe it to yourself to upgrade. And why not? Browsers are free. You're lucky. I remember <strong>paying</strong> for Netscape Navigator 4 just to escape Internet Explorer in the 90s. That's how much I loathed it- and that's how popular Netscape used to be. For the stubborn who refuse to upgrade, you are about to be left behind.

368,Inclind Launches Washingtons Green Grocer,2010-02-28,"<p>	<a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> is the brainchild of John (Zeke) Zechiel and his wife Lisa. After identifying the need for better produce and deliverables versus store bought goods, John and Lisa planted the seeds for <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> in 1994. Every week, <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> provides customers with tentative lists of fruits and vegetables that will be available, and each customer can pick and choose what they would like delivered (yep, home delivery!) for that week through their online account. Providing unmatched service and 100% dedication to custom satisfaction, <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> has been wildly popular and has exploded in the DC metro area. They currently serve all of Washington DC and the surrounding suburban areas in Maryland and Virginia from Severna Park to Arlington and all points in between north and south.</p><h2>	How does it work?</h2><p>	Every week, <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> selects 12 to 14 different fruits and vegetables and delivers them to your doorstep. On Friday&#39;s, they email customers a tentative list for the next weeks delivery. If there is anything on the list you don&#39;t want, you can log into your account and customize your box. For example, you can choose to receive only 7 items instead of the full box, or substitute items for other items. Each customer can choose exactly what they want and get it without fail every single week. You can also set custom schedules for delivery, such as every other week, or once a month, or schedule around vacation time. It&#39;s all up to the customer!</p><h2>	Application</h2><p>	Such business growth commands the necessity of a powerful web application to tie all the logic together and keep things running smoothly. After getting tired of the shortcomings of their previous system, Zeke contacted us and we started talking about a full redesign of the front end and a re-architecting of the back end. After planning and mind-mapping the application to the last detail, Inclind began work on the project early in the summer of this year. Their initial website was built on a rigid and inflexible Coldfusion system. The first order of business was getting all the existing data out and into the new system and giving it structure to make it easy to work with. As with all our sites, we begin with a base install of Drupal 6 to build from. Drupal is the <strong>best</strong> CMF (content management framework) available right now. Other packages that are simply CMS (content management systems- Plone, Wordpress, Joomla) are not as adaptable and flexible as Drupal. To handle the business end of things, Ubercart takes care of the day to day transactions for customers. There are over 5,000 active customers in the system. To make it as easy as possible to get started, we ask for your basic information up front and allow you to pick your items for delivery. After your account is created, a staff member at Washington&#39;s Green Grocer selects the most appropriate truck route for you and you will begin receiving deliverables on the next scheduled day. At this point, a customer can login at any time and adjust their delivery schedule, items for delivery, or halt deliveries. Customers can also browse recipes on the site and submit their own. Washington&#39;s Green Grocer promotes healthy eating habits and you will find plenty of recipes on their website for that.</p><h2>	Backend</h2><p>	Along with the new visuals and customer functionality, we needed to build and provide lots of cool administrative stuff into the backend for easy management of customers, data, and content. We also needed to be able to actively map delivery truck routes through Google Maps on demand and be able to filter them in a variety of ways. This helps <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> visually assess their delivery routes, their customers, and orders. We also also extended on that to provide filtering tools to narrow it down further to specific routes, specific clients, specific orders or orders with specific kinds of products. <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washingtons Green Grocer</a> staff also have a variety of reporting tools at their disposal for viewing customer trends, requests, future forecasting, and production reports.

409,How to Write a Good Blog Post - Beginners,2010-07-13,"<p>	One thing Inclind prides itself on, as a company, is that we strive to do what is right for the client. Not everyone has time for blogging, facebook, and twitter, not to mention the other myriad of social media/marketing applications out there, so we don&#39;t coerce our clients into a marketing technique that they won&#39;t succeed in. The truth is that most just don&#39;t <em><strong>make</strong></em> the time, because they assume it is more time consuming than it is in reality. But for those of you who might think blogging will soak up your whole career, or even an entire day, we have good news.</p><p>	<strong>Here are some tips:</strong></p><ul>	<li>		Schedule Writing/Delegate</li>	<li>		Keep SEO in Mind</li>	<li>		Have an Attack Plan</li></ul><h3>	Schedule Writing/Delegate</h3><p>	It&#39;s tough to make time in a busy schedule without creating a slot for your goal. If you are the CEO of your company, pick someone you trust within your company to write in your stead so you can focus on your own tasks, much like Shaun did with me and the post you&#39;re reading now.</p><p>	Have them schedule the writing as if it were a meeting, with time alloted for research. Most calendar applications allow for a reoccuring event, so the staff member could easily make a second-tuesday-of-every-month penning appointment. One good blog post per month is a realistic, acceptable goal, but one-a-month event is easy to overlook, so put it in the calendar! Remember: <strong>a goal without a date is a wish</strong>.</p><h3>	Keep SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in Mind</h3><p>	The overview of this tip is this: keep your target demographic in mind at all times. Read on for details.</p><p>	a.) Forget Industry Terms<br />	b.) Longtail Keywords</p><p>	<strong>Forget Industry Terms (For the Most Part)</strong></p><p>	If you are writing to educate the general public on a certain term or two, then use technical terminology. Avoid writing for the sake of showing you know college words. The easier the read, the more people will pay attention. Let this point stick: the purpose of the blog post is to draw traffic from search engines, so use the words your potential clients would use to find you in your content.</p><p>	<strong>Longtail Keywords</strong></p><p>	This is a bit deep for beginners, but here comes an introduction. Since we are on the subject of SEO, we might as well breech <em>longtail keywords</em>. If you are a fencing installation startup, or a tattoo shop, don&#39;t ever expect to come up first for the search of &quot;fencing&quot; or &quot;tattoo shop.&quot; These are too broad. To be honest, the majority of traffic driven to your site will leave quickly.</p><p>	Much more successful are our clients that use very narrow, very specific keyword groupings. Think &quot;Orange County, California Tattoo Studio&quot; versus our previous &quot;tattoo shop&quot; example. This is a quality vs. quantity argument, but if you are found by the majority of people ready to buy from you or someone close, it is likely to bring more business/profit. Websites costs money, so use the leverage you have to bring that money back in.</p><h3>	Have an Attack Plan</h3><p>	Most of our clients just starting out writing their blog need a bit of guidance in assembling a solid post. Here is a formula I provide to our clients that helps them stay organized and generate a successful blog post more quickly:</p><ul>	<li>		Problem</li>	<li>		Solution</li>	<li>		Execution</li></ul><p>	While keeping the SEO benefits in mind, discuss a problem your client has in one paragraph, follow it with your solution strategy in the next, and then close with a solid example of how you have found success with this strategy in real-world situations. Statistics are always a strong persuasion tool in this conclusion. Including images is a great way to make reading a less danting task for your visitor because it breaks up the text.</p><h3>	All Done!</h3><p>	So writing a good blog post isn&#39;t so bad afterall. Just have a goal, schedule it, and write for the problem, solution, and execution formula. Simple!</p><p>	Stay tuned for future posts as we dive more into <a href=""/content/search-engine-optimization/index.htm"" title=""Blogging &amp; Search Engine Optimization From Your Delaware Web Designer"">Search Engine Optimization</a> strategies.</p>"," Search Engine Optimization, blog, tips, seo, search engine optimized content"

Both Google and Facebook have a projected reach of 50% by the close of this year (2010).</p><p>	<strong>Choice:</strong> While the bulk of advertising is spent on gambles, Facebook and Google both display your ad to users most likely interested in your product based on user bios and searches, respectively. Since Facebook allows users to opt in to being a fan or, currently, &ldquo;liking&rdquo; your biz page, your updates are delivered to your loyal following.</p><h3>	Use Facebook to your advantage with minimal time consumption.</h3><p>	<strong>Schedule it.</strong> Like most things, lack of time is the biggest deterrent from social networking. Pick your <em>most likely</em> day and time of the week, and schedule <em><strong>5</strong> minutes</em> to post something relative to your field that people will care about. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be about your company, it can be related news or tips, or a link to a great blog post, whether written by you or not. This will keep your on the forefront of your followers&rsquo; brains as the &ldquo;Go-To&rdquo; leader in your industry. As an added benefit, Facebook business pages are public, so your posts show in Google and other search engines, which could get you more followers, drive more traffic, and spark more business.</p><p>	<strong>Make it easy.</strong> For most, social marketing can be like exercising. It&rsquo;s not a great deal of fun AND it soaks up what little time your day may have. So, make it easier on yourself. Already write a blog? Just post a link to the blog as your weekly update. Are you a real estate company? Give a quick pitch and link to a featured listing. You will be more likely to follow through if updating the world via Facebook is a quick, manageable goal. Much like exercise, it&rsquo;s better to be brief and consistent than spend an entire morning focused on this task, burn out, and avoid it for four weeks.</p><p>	<strong>Be interesting.</strong> The purpose in networking is to develop a strong presence. Those who like who you are will most likely follow you and spread your name whether they are interested in your product or not. It is more accepted than ever to loosen that professional collar and show your own personality. We mentioned in the first tip that you could post news, but it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be about your industry. Inclind cares about our environment, regarding both the economy and eco-system. We frequently post updates about farmers&rsquo; markets or push local businesses and their products. It&rsquo;s common for those who are big supporters of these things to spread the word and push our company in return.</p><h3>	Not so bad, right?</h3><p>	All you need to kick off a successful social media campaign is 5 minutes per week, a consistent attack, and the desire to push your industry. Your target demographic will begin to find you if you take these baby steps in the right direction. Once you see the payoff, you&#39;ll start dedicating more time and resources toward taking advantage of these marketing tools.</p><p>	Next time we&#39;ll discuss twitter and utilizing Tweetdeck to make social media easier than ever.</p>"," Search Engine Optimization, seo, facebook, social media, marketing"
413,"How to fix a Drupal \""Node no longer exists\"" Error",2010-08-11,"<p>	When working with Drupal and XML/SOAP data, you might be coding right along and run into this error:</p><blockquote>	Warning: unserialize() [function.unserialize]: Node no longer exists</blockquote><p>	What happened?!</p><p>	Well, if you are working with XML/SOAP data and try to save it with variable_set() or watchdog(), both of these Drupal functions serialize the data before they are saved to the database, a common method of saving and logging changes in Drupal.</p><p>	However, if you are parsing XML with SimpleXML, you may think you are working with a string, but in fact are working with a object. What happens then is when variable_set(), watchdog() or functions like it are called, the data passed in is run through serialize and later read with unserialize.</p><p>	The problem with that is SimpleXML can create objects with invisible properties, and when Drupal tries to serialize your data, its expecting a string and not an object. The quick way around this is to typecast the value you want to save:</p><p>	<strong>Before:</strong></p><p>	<code>if ($xml_response) { watchdog(&#39;mymodule&#39;, &#39;User @user saved, key @key&#39;, array(&#39;@user&#39; =&gt; $user-&gt;name, &#39;@key&#39; =&gt; $xml_response-&gt;MyResponseObject-&gt;unique_key_value), WATCHDOG_NOTICE); } </code></p><p>	<strong>After:</strong></p><p>	<code>if ($xml_response) { $key = (string)$xml_response-&gt;MyResponseObject-&gt;unique_key_value; watchdog(&#39;mymodule&#39;, &#39;User @user saved, key @key&#39;, array(&#39;@user&#39; =&gt; $user-&gt;name, &#39;@key&#39; =&gt; $key), WATCHDOG_NOTICE); } </code></p><p>	But wait, you changed your code, and you still see the error at the top of your page?</p><p>	No problem. Now the issue is that you have data in the database that you need to get rid of, because Drupal is trying to read the borked entries back with unserialize(). In my example above, all I needed to do was the following in MySQL:</p><p>	<code>TRUNCATE watchdog; </code></p><p>	This clears out the watchdog table, getting rid of my bad logs. If you saved a variable the same way I was trying to save a response above, you will either need to go in with MySQL and delete the variable, or you can do variable_del(&#39;variable_name&#39;); in the code with the same effect.</p><p>	Hope this helps!</p>"," drupal, drupal development, drupal cache error, drupal node not found, delaware web developer"

419,Discover Dogfishes New Product Finder!,2010-11-16,"<p>	The first inception of the Dogfish brew finder relied on the consumers to feed us the information about where they found Dogfish brews. At the time, we could not obtain data directly from the distributors. Using the Location module, registered users could come to the site and put in a place where they bought Dogfish, restaurants, beer stores, bars, venues. The data was then mapped onto a Google map, where you could search by state, country, or location type.</p><p>	Adding locations was one of the most popular features of the site. In just over a year, we collected nearly 10,000 user submitted locations in the United States, Canada, UK, and Europe. Fans of Dogfish could let other fans know exactly where they were finding their favorite brews.</p><p>	This year, Dogfish partnered with <a href=""http://vtinfo.com/www/generic/"" target=""_blank"">Vermont Information Processing</a> systems and their brew distributors to hook into a centralized database that collected information about where brews were being distributed to. Each time a distributor ships product out to retailers, data about the retail location and products are saved to the VIP system. This provides an accurate representation of where Dogfish is being shipped to and what locations are carrying, and its updated often.</p><p>	In a couple of days, we recoded the product finder to take advantage of the service VIP&#39;s system could offer. Users can now go to <a href=""http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/fish-finder.htm"" target=""_blank"">dogfish.com</a>, enter their zip code and quickly be given locations near them.

427,Back from Drupalcon Chicago!,2011-03-11,"<p>	This blog post is coming at you from 35,000 feet in the air. Lookout below!</p><p>	This week we were able to attend our second Drupalcon as a company. For those who don&#39;t know, Drupalcon is a gathering of web developers, web designers, and companies who work on Drupal who gather twice a year to show off new things, hold informative sessions, and network with others. This year, it was in Chicago. None of us had been to Chicago before, but had always wanted to go (crossing off our list). Small town folk in a big boy town. Eye opening indeed.</p><p>	Drupalcon Chicago was even bigger than the one in DC in 2009. More sessions, more speakers, more fun. There was an estimated 3000 people in attendance. I noticed at least two dozen community noteables walking around on the first day. Folks like Dries Butayert (lead), K&aacute;roly N&eacute;gyesi chx (core), Jen Simmons (themer / HTML5 initiative), Jeff Eaton (Lullabot), Angie Byron (webchick, Lullabot), and countless others from Phase 2, Development Seed, Acquia and Commerce Guys. Even Jeremy Keith was there. He assisted on HTML5 spec, I&#39;ve read his book &quot;HTML5 for Web Designers&quot; (twice!), he&#39;s well respected and very sharp guy.&nbsp;</p><p>	We have always been an steadfast fan/supporter of our friends at Development Seed (Washington D.C.) from their work, their contributions and their passion to help others. If you haven&#39;t seen what they do, check them out. They are really doing amazing stuff, doing their part to change the world where they can. It was a real pleasure hearing Eric Gunderson (DevSeed CEO) speak in a few sessions. He is a very intelligent, driven, passionate individual. Eric simply eminates a love for what he does (as does all DevSeed), is brutally honest, and runs a very talented team. Ian, if you&#39;re reading this, sorry we could not meet up- bring the team out to Dogfish Head for a day this spring!</p><p>	We also enjoyed amazing presentations by Larry Garfield (Palantir), Steven Merrill (Treehouse Agency), Jeff Eaton (Lullabot), Jen Simmons (Palantir), and Tim Cosgrove &amp; Brian McMurray (Treehouse Agency). There is so much information to digest, we are collecting our thoughts to discuss as a team as to how we can use the knowledge to better our company and give back to the community.</p><p>	We love working with Drupal, working with others, and helping people succeed. Our experience at Drupalcon reinforced our belief in the directions we are taking our own company as well as supporting others, and making projects successful.</p><p>	Drupal 7 is killer, and Drupal 8 is going to be bigger, badder, and better than you&#39;ve ever seen Drupal or any other content management system.

430,Passwords and Simple Practices to Protect Your Data,2011-05-06,"<p>	Last month, <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/sony-admits-utter-psn-failure-your-personal-data-has-been-stolen.ars"" target=""_blank"">Sony released information to the public about a massive breach on their networks, resulting in 75 million user accounts worth of information exposed</a>, including my own. I am a PS3 owner, and a soon-to-be canceller of my PSN account (when it comes back online, that is). Other major network breaches, like the one on <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2277768/"" target=""_blank"">Gawker controlled websites</a>, <a href=""http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/plentyoffish-hacked/"" target=""_blank"">Plenty of Fish dating site</a>, or even recently, the <a href=""http://blog.lastpass.com/2011/05/lastpass-security-notification.html"" target=""_blank"">possible breach of data at LastPass</a>&nbsp;are scary reminders that our data is public and may, someday, find its way into the wrong hands.</p><p>	The breach on Sony&#39;s networks will go down as the largest in history. The PSN (as well as other online subscription controlled Sony games, like Everquest) was, for lack of better words, poorly architected and security was an afterthought. For almost a year, the folks at Sony knew that the server technology was outdated version of Apache and a flavor of Linux, unprotected and not behind a firewall. A class action is now being formed against Sony and their part described as &#39;criminal negligence&#39; for not taking steps to protect its customers, even after being notified about network weaknesses. Creditors and banks are now getting involved to determine why Sony was not being PCI compliant, who was responsible, and what the damages will be.</p><p>	Believe it or not, hackers were able to determine that purchases or other data sent over the PSN network were sent in clear text URL, including user name, password, credit card number, expiration and CVV code. Although Sony has denied that to be true, Sony also tried to finger Anonymous as being behind the attack to shift blame. While Anonymous claims to not have been involved (they typically tell the truth about what is and what is not their work), this false claim by Sony now has the FBI/DOJ and other branches of government interested in this case. The result will most likely be millions of dollars spent on an investigation and court case(s) to only find out what we already know: Sony did not take any steps to protect its users.</p><p>	I and many other people just learned the hard way that you can never assume big companies know what they are doing when it comes to online security. This is Sony, one of the worlds largest electronics manufacturers, with a great console, and free online store/network play. They must know what they are doing over in the Sony gaming network branch, its all they focus on, right? Wrong.</p><p>	The PSN network is still down/unaccessible nearly a month later. This may cripple the future of the next Playstation or other Sony endeavors involving home console gaming or online subscription play/payments. While they may recover financially, the major blow to their credability may be forever irreparable (at least for 75-77 <strong>million</strong> people who&#39;s data was leaked- you know, the entire base of customers).</p><p>	As users, we should trust that a company is as secure as they say they are when we hand over our information online. But, as Murphy&#39;s Law states, anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. If you&#39;ve been through this before, you undoubtedly know the consequences that can happen when data is snatched. Changing bank account numbers, credit cards and passwords is quite the hassle.</p><p>	What can you do?</p><p>	It is important, for one, to use a different password for every site or service that requests a password. Using the same password for everything is asking for trouble- if an account is compromised on one site, all your accounts are at risk. Don&#39;t be a victim, because you will only have yourself to blame for that.</p><p>	We suggest that you use a service like <a href=""http://strongpasswordgenerator.com/"" target=""_blank"">Strong Password Generator</a>&nbsp;to generate a password 15 or more characters in length. We know, you can&#39;t possibly remember a generated password. That&#39;s the point. Coupled with a service like <a href=""http://www.lastpass.com"" target=""_blank"">LastPass</a>, <a href=""http://agilebits.com/products/1Password/Mac"" target=""_blank"">1Password</a>, or <a href=""http://keepass.info/"" target=""_blank"">KeePass</a>, your passwords are just a click away ready to be used.

This is a mistake most people make with their password. Password cycling is a good habit to have. Every 30 days, change some of your passwords. If you do use a service like LastPass, password cycling is a definite plus. Once you do learn of a possible breach, changing all your passwords is mandatory.</p><p>	Be proactive.

437,Google takes on Facebook with Google+,2011-07-12,"<p>I&#39;ve been a user of social networks before there was ever such a term.</p><p>In the 90s, there were multitudes of online communities where users could share content and maintain an online presence. For me it was Geocities, one of the better networks in the mid 90s. I taught myself HTML here, maintained a few websites and regularly chatted with other users. Others ran message boards, the more popular ones showing what would become huge in the next decade: focus on the user and their network of friends. It was easy to see where this was all going, that the internet was more than just a place to lookup cheat codes, play Quake and download cool wallpapers.</p><p>One of the earliest actual social networks I can recall is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster"" target=""_blank"">Friendster</a>. Launched in 2002, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster"" target=""_blank"">Friendster</a> allowed users to create a profile, add friends, and share content. Within the first few months they had reached 3 million users, a small fraction of the giant social networks today. However, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster"" target=""_blank"">Friendster</a> would lay the roadmap of where we are now.</p><p>Not long after that, other companies started to get in the game. In 2003, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Bebo joined the fray, soon followed by the monolithic Facebook in 2004.</p><p>I maintained a profile on MySpace for close to 6 years. Before Facebook became popular (or should say, opened registration up to more than a few dozen colleges) - this was the primary way friends would share and interact online. Social networking at that point was still rough around the edges and not a totally polished experience. That all changed when Facebook opened up to the public and became the worlds largest network, with over 750 million registered users as of July 2011.</p><p>Given the runaway success of Facebook, other social networks have all but died off and became a fading memory. MySpace, acquired by NewsCorp for $580 million in 2005, sold earlier this year for just $35 million. They are currently trying to rebrand and reboot the name. Facebook, on the other hand, has been given valuations of anywhere from 10 to 40 billion dollars. Could anyone step up and change the game on a network of almost a billion users?</p><p>Enter Google. Google is currently beta testing their hot new social network called <a href=""https://plus.google.com"" target=""_blank"">Google+ (Google Plus)</a>, however this is not Google&#39;s first foray into social networking. Google launched <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut"" target=""_blank"">Orkut</a> in 2004, wildly popular in countries like Brazil and east Asia, but never took off here in North America. There were always rumors that Google would release a new social networking product, and sure enough earlier this year, they annouced their new network on an invite only basis. Like other Google products, this invite-only access caused those uninvited (even myself) to cry failure before launch, because after all, what is a social networking site if you can&#39;t get your friends in?</p><p>Google started throwing invites out left and right earlier this month and opened up public registrations for a limited time each day. This was to counter the product announcement(s) by Facebook, who announced service upgrades to compete with what Google was now offering with Google+. I have been in Google+ for over a week now, and I think it is a good contender to do battle with Facebook.</p><h2>Interface</h2><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/google-plus-1.jpg"" style=""width: 584px; height: 398px; "" /></p><p>Right off the bat, the UI is very familiar and laid out similar to Facebook with all the common elements where you would look for them. Picture, top left. Content stream, center page. Additional information in the right sidebar, chat in the left sidebar. However, Google+&#39;s implementation of this is much cleaner and feels better overall than Facebooks more compact/condensed structure. The UI is free of the usual clutter found on other sites, allowing you to quickly scan content, Circles, and updates.</p><p>Google+ has automatic integration with the new Google toolbar as well. From anywhere within the Google suite of tools, you can respond to Google+ notifications without returning to Google+. Support is also coming to allow you to respond and post via email as well. It is a nice change of pace to be able to do this without having to be on Google+ all the time, and I would expect many Chrome plugins to become available when the Google+ API opens up later this year to extend this functionality.</p><p>Posting has direct integration with other products like Google Maps and YouTube. Oh, you can also edit posts after you have posted them, an obvious feature that Facebook has missed (or refused) to implement. So don&#39;t worry about making a big post and having a typo or busted link, you can quickly edit it and correct the error.</p><h2>Circles</h2><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/imagecache/journal-post-thumb/google-plus-3.jpg"" style=""width: 610px; height: 380px; "" /></p><p>Firstly, the biggest difference between Google+ and Facebook is the use of &quot;Circles&quot; or different groups of people. This allows you to create a Circle for &quot;Coworkers&quot;, a circle for &quot;Friends&quot;, and a circle for &quot;Family&quot;, for instance. When sharing content, you can select which Circle has access to see the post (including, albums, photos, and videos) with just a single click, and voila, you instantly have limited access content. This is much simplified and abstract over Facebook Groups, which is sepereated off the main social graph into its own area, and even the basic post functionality of Facebook which does not easily allow for securing acccess to content. I&#39;ve read there are ways of giving permission to who sees what per post, but I can&#39;t figure it out at all, it&#39;s not clear with Facebook. On Google+, it couldn&#39;t be any easier. Have a nerdy website to share with coworkers? Paste the link into the post box, select &quot;Coworkers&quot; - boom, done. No more awkward moments when your grandmother asks &quot;What&#39;s that Reddit thing all about anyway?&quot;.</p><p>This functionality is not limited to just groups of people either, you can also type in a friends name to give just that friend access to see it and no one else. This main differentiator is a huge draw to Google+ over Facebook, since this has been a major flaw since Facebook ever began. You want users to share, but users don&#39;t want everyone to see <em>everything</em>. Along with this, adding people to circles is not mutually exclusive, much like Twitter. There does not need to be an implicit relationship to follow what other users are doing.</p><h2>Photos and Videos</h2><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/imagecache/journal-post-thumb/google-plus-2.jpg"" style=""width: 610px; height: 315px; "" /></p><p>Like any social network, Google+ offers you the ability to create and upload picture or video albums. For the moment there does not seem to be any file size limit on uploads, I uploaded 15 3mb photos at once, and one 100mb video. You&#39;ll find all the same intelligent upload and photo editing tools as you would on Facebook, however, the presentation of content here really shines. Clever use of HTML5 breathes new life into an old concept by making photos or videos appear in a modal overlay with comments lined up on the right hand side of the frame, with sequential content in the bottom of the frame. While this sounds relatively basic, it works, and is a breath of fresh air over Facebooks unchanged style over the years. There is actually a sense of enjoyment and engagement from flicking through users media for once. My only gripe here though, I can&#39;t find a way to rename an album after I create it. I could not find this option anywhere, and I would assume this functionality is forthcoming.</p><h2>Hangouts &amp; Chat</h2><p>&quot;Hangouts&quot; are a feature of Google+ that allow you to create video chat rooms and invite multiple friends for video chatting. While I haven&#39;t used this much (I don&#39;t have a webcam) other users are reporting this feature to work better than Facebooks new Skype powered video chat. I can imagine this will be big for brands or companies as a cheap alternative to Webex or other teleconferencing solutions as this is completely free. GChat is also integrated with Google+ so you can chat with people in your Circles- you can also limit access to GChat by selecting different Circles, so you can&#39;t be bombarded if you are really popular and just want to limit it to certain friends.</p><h2>Mobility</h2><p>Google+ is built on HTML5 and javascript, complete with a mobile version of the site like other Google products. This is an immediate leg up over Facebook, who&#39;s mobile app rarely gets feature/bug updates. While Android users can upload photos through the web app, iPhone users will need to wait for the G+ app to hit the AppStore. Besides that, most of the functionality exists in the mobile version of the site.</p><h2>Public Access</h2><p>Public access is still limited to invite only, with reports that it will open up to the public on July 31st of this year. If you would like to be invited before that, <a href=""/contact-us.htm"">send us an email</a> and we will shoot you an invite.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Google+ is off to a great start in the social networking world, reaching almost 10 million users in just a month to mostly postive feedback. I know a handful of Facebook friends who are already sizing down and migrating friends over to Google+ (due in large part to the security features of posting). This is one of the most polished products I have seen from Google in a long time, and has the ability to go the distance and be a game changer in a field that has had no contenders since Facebook emerged in 2004. While there are some gripes, like not being able to delete comments on photos, rename albums, or the mobile version&#39;s oft lethargic speed, these are quite minor to the bigger picture and obviously will be corrected as time goes by. To get the most out of the experience, it is important to invite your friends in and encourage them to try it out. Otherwise, some users find it difficult to use without a Circle larger than 12 people to interact with. My main Circle is nearing 100 and I am enjoying the experience. Google+ is fast becoming my main point of communication with others, and may even threaten the necessity of Twitter (powerusers who combine Circles and posting to mimic Twitter) due to the flexibility of the service.</p><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href=""http://webtrickz.com/20-google-tips-to-enhance-your-google-plus-experience/"" target=""_blank"">25 Google+ tips to Enhance your Google Plus Experience</a></li><li><a href=""http://webtrickz.com/why-the-built-in-photo-editor-on-google-rocks/"" target=""_blank"">Using the Built-In Photo Editor in Google Plus</a></li><li><a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EA38qOrc8_4/Thm4iyghvxI/AAAAAAAAAE8/eOA3Vvy3BBA/GooglePlusCheatSheet.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Google Plus Cheat Sheet</a></li></ul>"," social networking, facebook, Social Media, google plus, g"

After a bit of research and module testing I just didn&#39;t find a solution that worked for Drupal 7.</p><p>Previously, using Drupal 6 we had parsed an RSS feed of a specific user account but that recipe didn&#39;t quite work now that Twitter has put an emphasis on using their REST API (or Streaming API). No biggie, we work with multiple APIs on a daily basis, and the Twitter REST API is pretty cool.</p><h2>The Basic Recipe</h2><p>The basic recipe starts with a foundation of <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/drupal"" target=""_blank"">Drupal 7</a> with the following modules (versions are noted but I doubt they&#39;ll be accurate for long):</p><ul><li><a href=""http://drupal.org/project/feeds"" target=""_blank"">Feeds</a>&nbsp;(7.x-2.0-alpha4)</li><li><a href=""http://drupal.org/project/feeds_jsonpath_parser"" target=""_blank"">Feeds JSONPath Parser</a>&nbsp;(7.x-1.0-beta2)</li><li><a href=""http://drupal.org/project/views"" target=""_blank"">Views</a>&nbsp;(7.x-3.0-rc1)</li></ul><p>* Drush commands: &#39;drush dl job_scheduler&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;feeds_jsonpath_parser&nbsp;views&#39;, &#39;drush en feeds feeds_ui&nbsp;feeds_jsonpath_parser views views_ui job_scheduler&#39;</p><p>* Don&#39;t forget to follow the install instructions for feeds_jsonpath_parser (download a file and clear cache, not hard).</p><h2>What is JSON?</h2><p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a super quick text based format for sending and receiving data, similar to XML. JSON allows the sending of data in a much lighter and more human readable method, making it faster and easier to parse the data on the receiving end. A lot of web apps, APIs and web services make use of or offer JSON as one of its data formats.</p><h2>Learn the Twitter Search API</h2><p>Now its time to familiarize yourself with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search"" target=""_blank"">Twitter Search API</a>&nbsp;and the source feed data. You&#39;ll find that queries can be made based on user account (to and from), hashtag and even geography. Some example queries include:</p><ul><li>User account:&nbsp;http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=to%3A[USERNAME]%20OR%20from%3A[USERNAME]</li><li>Hashtag:&nbsp;http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=%23[HASHTAG]</li></ul><p>You should definatley try out&nbsp;<a href=""http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/"" target=""_blank"">http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/</a>. It will make your life livable while figuring our how to map the JSON data when configuring the feed (Cheers! to <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/1060956#comment-4105342"" target=""_blank"">7wonders</a> for this reference). See what I&#39;m talking about:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/json-viewer.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 500px; "" /></p><h2>Setup the Feed</h2><p>So, at this point the modules are installed and you&#39;ve taken a moment to scroll up and down the Twitter Search API documentation page. Now the configuration can begin:</p><h3>Content Types</h3><p>The Feeds module will need two content types setup. Its bascially a parent / child type setup. I setup the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Twitter Feed</strong></li><li><strong>Tweets</strong>&nbsp;- I added fields to correlate to the JSON results above.</li></ul><h3>Configure the Feed</h3><p>Navigation to the feed importers interface (/admin/structure/feeds) and click the &quot;New Importer&quot; tab:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-importer_0.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>Give the feed a name like &quot;Twitter Import&quot;, a machine name &quot;twitter_import&quot; and a friendly description so you know why this was configured 6 months from now.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-importer2.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>Viola, you have a new feed. Configuration time!</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-importer3.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>You&#39;ll need to first attach the feed to the Twitter Feed content type:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-1.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>The fetcher settings are find. Jump down and change the parser to JSONPath parser:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-2.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>The node processor settings need some adjustment. You want Tweet nodes generated when the feed processes so change the Content Type accordingly. You may also want to fiddle with the text format setting etc...&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-3.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>Now the fun begins. My mappings look like this (basically covering the results we eyed earlier when looking at the JSON response from Twitter):</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-4.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 416px; "" /></p><p>Now that we have mappings, the JSONPath parser needs final configuration (take note of the context setting). Depending on what you query at Twitter the result set may differ:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-5_0.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 400px; "" /></p><h3>Setup a Twitter Feed Node</h3><p>Now you should be able to hit up /node/add and create a Twitter Feed node. Your twitter search API query will be entered here:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/drupal-feeds-twitter-6.png"" style=""width: 650px; height: 200px; "" /></p><p>The feed should process immediately upon saving and generate Tweet nodes if there are results for your search.</p><h2>Views of Tweets</h2><p>Now that we have nodes being generated for various Twitter queries a page or block view might be in order.....if you are interested in the presentation side of rending a tweet let me know...I&#39;m out of time for this post.</p><p>Thanks to all those who contribute to the Drupal project and contrubted modules like Feeds and Feeds JSONPath Parser!</p>"," delaware web developer, data integration, Integration, drupal 7, twitter, feeds module, json, mobile websites, importing feeds in drupal, twitter rss is gone"
445,Adding WYSIWYGs to Custom Drupal Forms with FormAPI,2011-08-26,"<p>One of the greatest assets in any Drupal developer&#39;s toolbox is the FormAPI. With the FormAPI, you can do just about anything. Form wizards, multistep forms, custom contact forms, image uploaders, there is no limit. Combining Drupal&#39;s FormAPI with CTools API grants even greated flexibility, such as object caching and advanced wizard forms.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re going to start off with something simple: adding a WYSIWYG to a custom Drupal 7 form with the FormAPI.</p><p>What you&#39;ll need (if you don&#39;t already have it):</p><ul><li><a href=""http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg"" target=""_blank"">WYSIWYG Module</a></li><li>CKEditor, FCKEditor, or TinyMCE</li><li>Restricted input formats (Filtered HTML, etc) with access permissions assigned to roles</li></ul><p>Assuming you already have a form in progress with your custom module (or perhaps you are modifying an existing form with hook_form_alter):</p><p>$form[&#39;mytextarea&#39;] = array(<br />&nbsp; &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;textarea&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Basic Textarea&#39;<br />&nbsp; &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; &#39;This is a basic plain textarea. Boo.&#39;,<br /> );</p><p>The above code will make a basic textarea appear in your form. With a couple of changes, we can easily add a WYSIWYG:</p><p>$form[&#39;mytextarea&#39;] = array(<br />&nbsp; &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;text_format&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;WYSIWYG Textarea&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#base_type&#39; =&gt; &#39;textarea&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; &#39;Woohoo! I am a WYSIWYG now!&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#format&#39; =&gt; &#39;filtered_html&#39;,<br />);</p><p>That&#39;s all it takes! Keep in mind roles will need access to different formats and editors before it will appear for them. For the #format declaration, you need to use the machine name of the input format- in my example it&#39;s filtered_html.</p><p>Sweet! Now we have a WYSIWYG on our form, and the input format will allow for text formatting.</p><p>But, what if we want to adjust the size of the WYSIWYG? CSS and Javascript not working? That&#39;s okay, we can set javascript directly from the FormAPI too with the #attached property. Let&#39;s say we want to adjust the height of the WYSIWYG area:</p><p>$form[&#39;mytextarea&#39;] = array(<br />&nbsp; &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;text_format&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;WYSIWYG Textarea&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#base_type&#39; =&gt; &#39;textarea&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; &#39;Woohoo! I am a WYSIWYG now!&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#format&#39; =&gt; &#39;filtered_html&#39;,<br />&nbsp; &#39;#attached&#39; =&gt; array(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#39;js&#39; =&gt; array(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#39;description = setInterval(function() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (jQuery(&quot;#cke_contents_edit-mytextarea-value&quot;).length == 1) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jQuery(&quot;#cke_contents_edit-mytextarea-value&quot;).css(&quot;height&quot;, &quot;200px&quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } },1);&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;inline&#39;, &#39;scope&#39; =&gt; &#39;footer&#39;, &#39;weight&#39; =&gt; 5)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />);</p><p>Note that the above javascript is specific to CKEditor and will need minor adjustments for other editors. You can also change other properties of the WYSIWYG with this method too.</p><p>Badabing, now you have a WYSIWYG on your Drupal form!</p>"," Integration, drupal 7, drupal forms, drupal formapi, drupal wysiwyg"

Our computer lab, as it were, was equipped with a lot of Apple IIs (E series, I believe), green monitors, and big floppy drives. While we had a computer at home that was running Windows 95, I always loved the hour in computer class for one reason: I got to use something different.</p><p>We learned a lot on those machines. BASIC programming, typing, simple games and math software. It wasn&#39;t glitzy, flashy, or glamorous- it didn&#39;t really need to be. There was a lot of charm to the Apple II and for a lot of people, it still is.</p><p>In 9th grade, our school labs had Power Macs running Mac OS 8. This was an important year. Not only was I creating interactive movies with programs like HyperCard and publishing simple newsletters with Adobe PageMaker, it was the first time I got to truely experience the internet with a then little-known browser called Netscape 1.0. We sent our first emails, had our first chat.&nbsp;</p><p>Those were exciting times. The future was laid out in front of us, a sign of things to come, and Apple was there.</p><p>Apple changed my life again with the release of the iPod. In a little under an hour, I was free of CD players, CDs, junky Flash players and mountains of burned mixes. I was playing tracks for friends anywhere. My library, in my pocket. The iPod got me through college, late nights, work, sick days and more.</p><p>Apple changed <strong>everything</strong>. It wasn&#39;t just about the software, or the hardware. It was design, user experience. If you had to think about how, then it wasn&#39;t polished. Apple made technology transcend boxed, windowed interfaces into seamless UI where user intuition and typeface was tantamount and as important as what happened under the hood. It changed our industry, and most likely changed yours too.</p><p>Look around today. Websites, new products, advertisements, marketing - everyone wants to emulate the &#39;Apple&#39; way, <a href=""http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/preview"" target=""_blank"">including&nbsp;Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Make it work, make it make sense, don&#39;t make us think too hard.

448,Creating 'Share' Links Manually in Drupal,2011-10-14,"<p>Providing links to share content on social networks is a crucial component to most modern websites. While there are a few plugins and modules to accomplish this easily in Wordpress or Drupal, such as <a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social-media-widget/"" target=""_blank"">SocialMediaWidget</a> or <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/sharethis"">ShareThis</a>, there are instances when you need social sharing links to fit a custom design.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href=""http://help.sharethis.com/integration/drupal"" target=""_blank"">ShareThis</a> easily provides you with social media icons in a couple of different configurations. However, what if you wanted to achieve the following design element in your website?</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/social-bar.jpg"" style=""width: 594px; height: 30px; "" /></p><p style=""text-align: left; "">There is not going to be a code snippet generator from these services that will match your custom design. Fortunately, most social media services provide simple APIs so you can integrate share codes yourself for instances like this.</p><p style=""text-align: left; "">From the above image, we need to share content to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Keep in mind that these links are meant to share content, and not necessarily generic links to social media services, or the account pages of the company you are viewing. We need to do a little work, so roll up those sleeves and get ready to do a little programming.</p><p style=""text-align: left; "">We really only need these links to do one simple thing, to allow you to share what you are looking at. To do that, all we need to do is pass a URL and title of the page, the social media services will take care of the rest. As a bonus, this design does not include like/tweet/plus counts, so the overhead of needing javascript and iframes to carry that is non-existent. If you ever wonder why sites like Mashable or TechCrunch feel super slow? Part of that is attributed to using the javascript code snippets to include their share links.</p><p style=""text-align: left; "">Facebook and Twitter are pretty straightforward. The basic link format for both services can be constructed like so:</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=&lt;url to share&gt;&amp;t=&lt;title of content&gt;</p><p>and</p><p>https://twitter.com/share?url=(url)</p><p>So lets get cracking! Drupal is going to make this really easy for us. All we have to utilize in the Drupal API is the url() function, so we can pass in a link and have it properly formatted without having to hardcode it (a no-no!). We also need to utilize PHPs urlencode function, so we can properly pass this data to our social media services.</p><p>The easiest place to make a change like this is in a view or node type template (.tpl) file in Drupal. Assuming you know how to do the required CSS for the image above, all we have left is to insert our links, with an image inside of them.</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=&lt;?php print urlencode(url($node-&gt;path, array(&#39;absolute&#39; =&gt; TRUE))) ?&gt;&amp;t=&lt;?php print urlencode($node-&gt;title) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php print base_path() . path_to_theme(); ?&gt;/images/fb-button.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;28&quot; height=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>and for Twitter:</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/share?url=&lt;?php print urlencode(url($node-&gt;path, array(&#39;absolute&#39; =&gt; TRUE))) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php print base_path() . path_to_theme(); ?&gt;/images/twitter-button.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;28&quot; height=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>That&#39;s all! So what is this actually doing?</p><p>url($node-&gt;path, array(&#39;absolute&#39; =&gt; TRUE));</p><p>The url() function in Drupal allows us to pass in a url with an array of options. Since we are working with a node template, Drupal already provides a loaded $node object for us, and one of its items is the path or url of the page. Since we need to use this on an outside website to link to, it needs to also contain the full domain for the URL to work. Passing the option &#39;absolute&#39; as TRUE will make the url() function return a full website url (i.e. http://www.inclind.com/journal/index.htm) - this also helps if you are working on multiple development sites for testing purposes because you will always have the domain returned correctly as opposed to hard coding it into the file.</p><p>Once the URL is returned, we then clean it up with urlencode which makes our content URL friendly and linkable. Now our image is wrapped in a working anchor tag for both Facebook and Twitter. They link to pages on both sites that understand how to read the URL and title that was passed in, and allow you to share or retweet what page you are on. It&#39;s that simple!</p><p>You can add however many social links you want provided they supply an API to use to facliitate the above examples. With it, there is no limit to what you can do if you&#39;re looking to have a custom / more unique appearance for your social media sharing bars.</p>"," facebook, Social Media, google plus, twitter, share content in drupal"

450,Washingtons Green Grocer has Relaunched!,2011-11-28,"<p>Over the last couple of weeks, Inclind has been working with Ripe and the folks at Washingtons Green Grocer to implement a design overhaul of their branding and website. Major props to the Ripe team for bringing a fresh look to a cool business. But, the design wasn&#39;t all that changed! There were a number of tools and UI changes implemented for customers and staff to help manage orders more effectively, plus some new features as well.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/wgg-2.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 329px; "" /></p><h2>Customer UI</h2><p>One of the first things we tackled was making for a better customer experience, from the registration process to account management, system messages and more. Taking a cue from Ripe, we overhauled and rewrote the application status messages as well as the error messages so the front-facing display was more friendly and easy to understand for the user.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/wgg-3.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 310px; "" /></p><p style=""text-align: center; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/wgg-4.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 492px; "" /></p><h2>HTML Mail &amp; Broadcast Emailing</h2><p>The underlying Drupal 6 mail framework was extended to send HTML formatted emails with templates, so every outgoing email from the application was branded with the new Green Grocer style, for a much better look and feel than standard plain text email. Along with this, we built a new interface to allow Zeke to filter down customers and email them a weekly personalized customer update. This way, he can send bulk emails to weekly customers, on demand customers, every other week customers, or customers with certain box types, for example.</p><h2>Amazon SES Cloud Based Email Service</h2><p>Going along with HTML formatted emails, we put some Amazon-muscle into Drupal by hooking it into the new <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/ses/"" target=""_blank"">Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)</a> cloud based mail delivery service. By changing the configuration of Postfix on the server to route through Amazon, Green Grocer can now send up to 50,000 (and rising) emails per day, at the rate of 14 emails per second. This allowed Green Grocer to drop Constant Contact practically overnight. In the last week alone, they&#39;ve successfully sent around 30,000 emails, and can efficiently send 10,000 emails in 30 minutes. Every week, Zeke creates a new weekly email, selects the recipients, and off they go!</p><h2>Amazon S3 / Nginx / Memcache</h2><p>To handle the bulk of traffic Green Grocer experiences weekly, we hosted most of the theme/design assets on Amazon S3, as well as putting Nginx and Memcache on the dedicated webserver to make Drupal really fly. When 3-6k people hit the site to change their box every Monday at 9 AM, the server barely hiccups.&nbsp;</p><p>The launch of the new Green Grocer website was met with very positive reactions from customers. The new branding changes also extended over into their social media campaigns, like Facebook, where they have gained almost 300 new followers in the first week. Soon, when Zeke moves his efforts into other metropolitan areas, other websites will open up branded for that city and run off the same application.</p><p>We&#39;re very proud of this successful launch with another powerful example of how flexible Drupal can be!</p><p>Website: <a href=""http://www.washingtonsgreengrocer.com"" target=""_blank"">Washington&#39;s Green Grocer</a></p>"," Integration, amazon ses drupal integration, amazon s3, drupal html mail, drupal customer balance, drupal subscription services, broadcast emails, drupal messaging solutions, send email with amazon and drupal"
451,Drupal & Responsive Design with the Omega HTML5 Base Theme,2011-12-05,"<p>We recently launched our latest project, <a href=""http://www.silicatodevelopment.com"" target=""_blank"">Silicato Development</a>, on the killer Drupal 7 platform. Among some of the great tools available for them to manage their website now, we also employed a responsive design so anyone could view their website on a desktop or mobile device.</p><p>What is responsive design? The aim of responsive design is to thoughtfully create one design for multiple devices (i.e. iPhone, iPad, etc.) and screen sizes. Instead of building a mobile site, a site specifically for tablets, and a standard desktop site, you provide one design that &quot;responds&quot; to the user&#39;s device and displays the content accordingly.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://www.silicatodevelopment.com"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/silicato-ss4.png"" style=""width: 621px; height: 440px; "" /></a></p><p>In the early stages of the design process for <a href=""http://www.silicatodevelopment.com"" target=""_blank"">Silicato Development&#39;s</a> web presence, we set out determined to build a responsive site that maintained complete usability and remained aesthetically pleasing. We leveraged a few awesome technologies to help us with this project. Drupal would supply the robust backend that the site&#39;s content driven pages would need. Omega, a responsive HTML5 base theme was utilized in order to achieve the &quot;responsive&quot; front end of the site. These two technologies combined allow for the site to display the same content on multiple different devices, screen sizes, &amp; browsers without having to build multiple sites.</p><p>When the site is viewed on a desktop browser the users are presented with a grid of projects that they can browse through. This grid is carried throughout the entire design and will display on tablets as well as mobile phones. In the screen shots below you can see the minor differences in the way the content is displayed when viewed from a desktop browser, a tablet, and a mobile phone.</p><p>The content is not altered in any way. The styling &amp; sizes may vary a bit between the presentation but the content, which is the most important part of the site is untouched. Utilizing the responsive design technique allows users to essentially have the same experience on the mobile site as the desktop site.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://www.silicatodevelopment.com"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/silicato-ss3.png"" style=""width: 388px; height: 447px; "" /></a></p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://www.silicatodevelopment.com"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/silicato-ss2.png"" style=""width: 275px; height: 409px; "" /><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/silicato-ss1.png"" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; width: 275px; height: 411px; "" /></a></p><p style=""text-align: left; "">We look forward to launching more sites using these techniques as well as the powerful flexibility Drupal 7 allows us to have with responsive design.</p>"," Web Design, html5, drupal 7, drupal mobile design, cms responsive designs, html5 mobile themes"

458,How to: Collecting Custom Dates in Drupal,2012-02-03,"<p>The FormAPI, first introduced in Drupal 4, is a very powerful API that allows you to create forms effortlessly. Every major release of Drupal, the FormAPI has become more mature and flexible, allowing you to create full forms with fields, and provide ways of altering them on output with #after_build, or hook_form_alter, for example.</p><p>In Drupal 7, the FormAPI has a &#39;date&#39; type form element. This field generally is used to collect data such as a birthdate, or a date in the future. By default, it provides a month, day, and year option as 3 inline select drop downs.</p><p>What if we need to be more specific, like collecting a credit card expiration date(s)? There are two requirements to that where Drupal has no way to set default formatting properties: we do not need to collect a day, and the years cannot be in the past.</p><p>Let&#39;s start by defining our form element:</p><pre>$form[&#39;credit_card_expiration&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;date&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Expiration Date&#39;,);</pre><p>Woohoo, we&#39;re on our way. Our date form field is now a part of our form:</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/exp-date-1.jpg"" style=""border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; width: 206px; height: 52px; "" /></p><p>So, how can we get rid of the day part, and adjust our year options? With the #after_build property, we can set a callback on that form element.</p><pre>$form[&#39;credit_card_expiration&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;date&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Expiration Date&#39;,  &#39;#after_build&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;mymodule_expiration_date_alter&#39;),);function mymodule_expiration_date_alter(&amp;$field) {  unset($field[&#39;day&#39;]);  unset($field[&#39;year&#39;][&#39;#options&#39;]);     for ($y = date(&#39;Y&#39;); $y &lt; date(&#39;Y&#39;) + 10; $y++) {    $options[$y] = $y;  }     $field[&#39;year&#39;][&#39;#options&#39;] = $options;     return $field;}</pre><p>The result is now a Date field with two inline select drop downs for month and year, with year being from 2012-2021!</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/exp-date-2.jpg"" style=""border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; width: 164px; height: 51px; "" /></p><p>As an added bonus, if you have <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/date"" target=""_blank"">Date</a> and <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/date"" target=""_blank"">Date Popup</a> modules enabled, you get more form field types: date_text and date_popup, both of which can have a couple of additional properties assigned, such as date_format. With the date_popup type, you get access to a jQuery style date picker which is extremely useful if you are collecting data, like a meeting or scheduling date. Our code is not that different:</p><pre>$form[&#39;schedule_date&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;date_popup&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Schedule Date&#39;,);</pre><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/exp-date-3.jpg"" style=""border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; width: 334px; height: 255px; "" /></p><p>Hot damn! Another great reason to use date or date_popup is that you know the data you get will be consistent. Leaving date fields as text fields opens up a lot of room for user error and complicated validation logic. Keep it simple! The possibilities are endless.</p>"," drupal, custom web development, Development, drupal 7 development, programming, form-api"
460,Adding Custom Form API Elements to Drupal,2012-03-31,"<p>In a previous post, we took a look at how to collect a customized date in Drupal. You may have noticed that there are warnings that the Day field are undefined, and that Drupal returns a form error saying the <a href=""http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21form.inc/function/date_validate/7"" target=""_blank"">&#39;specified date is invalid&#39;</a>. This is because we are not passing a day part. In most cases, you would, but using the previous example again of submitting a credit card expiration date, you don&#39;t need it. So, how can we solve this problem?</p><p>Drupal provides an easy way to define your own form elements through the use of <a href=""http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!system!system.api.php/function/hook_element_info/7"" target=""_blank"">hook_element_info</a>. With this function, we can quickly define new Form API elements to use- in this case, we want to create a custom date field, modeled after the core date field. While we&#39;re at it, lets also create two more fields that are related- credit card number, and credit card CVV code fields.</p><p>The code to define your elements is simple:</p><pre>function creditfield_element_info() {  $types[&#39;creditfield_cardnumber&#39;] = array(    &#39;#input&#39; =&gt; TRUE,    &#39;#element_validate&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;creditfield_cardnumber_validate&#39;),    &#39;#autocomplete_path&#39; =&gt; FALSE,    &#39;#process&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_process_creditfield&#39;),    &#39;#theme&#39; =&gt; &#39;textfield&#39;,    &#39;#theme_wrappers&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_element&#39;),    &#39;#maxlength&#39; =&gt; 16,  );  $types[&#39;creditfield_date&#39;] = array(    &#39;#input&#39; =&gt; TRUE,    &#39;#element_validate&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;creditfield_date_validate&#39;),    &#39;#process&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_process_creditfield_date&#39;),    &#39;#theme&#39; =&gt; &#39;date&#39;,    &#39;#theme_wrappers&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_element&#39;),  );  $types[&#39;creditfield_cvv&#39;] = array(    &#39;#input&#39; =&gt; TRUE,    &#39;#element_validate&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;creditfield_cvv_validate&#39;),    &#39;#autocomplete_path&#39; =&gt; FALSE,    &#39;#process&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_process_creditfield&#39;),    &#39;#theme&#39; =&gt; &#39;textfield&#39;,    &#39;#theme_wrappers&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;form_element&#39;),    &#39;#maxlength&#39; =&gt; 4,  );  return $types;}</pre><p>Breaking it down, we are simply defining 3 elements, validators, and processors. Since the date field is the complicated one, lets look at its #process callback, form_process_creditfield_date. This function determines how the field is constructed.</p><pre>function form_process_creditfield_date($element) {  // Default to current date  if (empty($element[&#39;#value&#39;])) {    $element[&#39;#value&#39;] = array(      &#39;month&#39; =&gt; format_date(REQUEST_TIME, &#39;custom&#39;, &#39;n&#39;),      &#39;year&#39; =&gt; format_date(REQUEST_TIME, &#39;custom&#39;, &#39;Y&#39;),    );  }  $element[&#39;#tree&#39;] = TRUE;  // Determine the order of month &amp; year in the site&#39;s chosen date format.  $format = variable_get(&#39;date_format_short&#39;, &#39;m/Y&#39;);  $sort = array();  $sort[&#39;month&#39;] = max(strpos($format, &#39;m&#39;), strpos($format, &#39;M&#39;));  $sort[&#39;year&#39;] = strpos($format, &#39;Y&#39;);  asort($sort);  $order = array_keys($sort);  // Output multi-selector for date.  foreach ($order as $type) {    switch ($type) {      case &#39;month&#39;:        $options = drupal_map_assoc(range(1, 12), &#39;map_month&#39;);        $title = t(&#39;Month&#39;);        break;      case &#39;year&#39;:        $options = drupal_map_assoc(range(date(&#39;Y&#39;, time()), date(&#39;Y&#39;, time()) + 10));        $title = t(&#39;Year&#39;);        break;    }    $element[$type] = array(      &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;select&#39;,      &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; $title,      &#39;#title_display&#39; =&gt; &#39;invisible&#39;,      &#39;#value&#39; =&gt; $element[&#39;#value&#39;][$type],      &#39;#attributes&#39; =&gt; $element[&#39;#attributes&#39;],      &#39;#options&#39; =&gt; $options,    );  }  return $element;}</pre><p>I modeled this after the Drupal core form_process_date function, except we have removed the &#39;day&#39; field logic, as well as changed the year options to be the current year plus 10 years, instead of the default of 1950-2050 range. When you call this field type in your form, you get a date field with just the month and year. Adding in the validation, there won&#39;t be too much more you have to do in your form:</p><pre>function creditfield_date_validate($element) {  if ($element[&#39;#value&#39;][&#39;year&#39;] == date(&#39;Y&#39;, time()) &amp;&amp; $element[&#39;#value&#39;][&#39;month&#39;] &lt; date(&#39;m&#39;, time())) {    form_error($element, t(&#39;Please enter a valid expiration date.&#39;));  }}</pre><p>When the form is submitted, this validate function is called because we defined that in #element_validate in our element definition. Its a rather simple check to see that the person has submitted a valid expiration date, which is nothing more than the date not being in the past if the year is the current year. So, a user should not be able to submit January 2012, for example.&nbsp;</p><h3>Now what?</h3><p>Great! Now you have some new field types for Drupal Form API to use. Let&#39;s use them! It is really easy to do:</p><pre>$form[&#39;credit_card_number&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;creditfield_cardnumber&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Credit Card Number&#39;,  &#39;#maxlength&#39; =&gt; 16,);    $form[&#39;expiration_date&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;creditfield_date&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Expiration Date&#39;,);$form[&#39;credit_card_cvv&#39;] = array(  &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;creditfield_cvv&#39;,  &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; &#39;CVV Code&#39;,  &#39;#maxlength&#39; =&gt; 4,  &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; &#39;Your 3 or 4 digit security code on the back of your card.&#39;,);</pre><p>Just your straightforward Form API code! That&#39;s it! You don&#39;t have to write any form validation callbacks, because the elements will fire them automatically, but you can still add more if you want. Now that there are new elements, you can create multiple forms without duplicating the validation code in each one.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to see the rest of the code, including credit card number validation, check out the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/creditfield"" target=""_blank"">Creditfield module</a>.</p>"," custom drupal development, drupal 7, Development, drupal form api, online payment, credit fields"

468,Prudential Gallo REALTORS Website Launches,2012-08-13,"<h3>Design, Layout, &amp; Theming</h3><p>We began building a brand new website from the ground up for Prudential Gallo REALTORS on the <a href=""http://drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">Drupal 7</a> platform, which included a new flexible and engaging design, a mobile website, and revamped content management workflow, sharpening the tools for the staff at Prudential Gallo and bringing them into a more modern look for 2012 and beyond.</p><p>One of our goals was&nbsp;to deviate from the trend and create a simple yet powerful real estate website that makes it easy to find properties and rentals without being drowned in checkboxes, drop downs, and endless forms to search for listings. Their previous website was good, but we wanted to really knock this one out of the park.</p><p>Shaun and Bryan put their creative brainpower together working in conjunction with Andrew Ratner at Prudential Gallo to come up with a user friendly design with a beachy color palette, using design elements to stand out amongst the rest. The site is based on HTML5 and CSS3 so it will last into the next few years no matter what browsers come out, instead of desiging for yesterday in current browsers.</p><p>The homepage features a &#39;megaslider&#39; that fills the screen, featuring hi-res shots of the area with text and links, swappable at any time or rotated on a schedule. Two search forms for real estate and rentals overlay on the slider above the fold, getting a majority of users where they want to go right off the bat. A mega menu was also incorporated to assist users in hopping around the major areas of the site quickly.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/prugallo-2_0.png"" style=""width: 630px; height: 410px; "" /></p><p>The real estate and rental searches were made to be much more simpler than they had previously been. This freed up not only space, but allowed users to search by the most common fields and get to where they were going quickly instead of mull over 50+ search options. Search results are presented in a &#39;monopoly card&#39; grid format, allowing more listings to appear in the results page without making the user scroll more. We were able to present a lot of information in each grid box, displaying a virtual tour badge, price, address and photo in a creative manner, an improvement over the old designs and a much more user friendly approach.</p><p>The new website also sends out a lot of email communication to its staff and customers. All email communications are branded with the same design and branding found on the website for a more personal touch.</p><p>A custom mobile design compliments the desktop version, showing the most critical information from the site in a condensed format, while retaining the Prudential Gallo brand and not feeling like a cookie cutter mobile template. Visitors can access the rental properties right from their phone, and call the appropriate rental office by pushing &#39;Call to Book&#39; from their phone.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/prugallo-1_0.png"" style=""width: 630px; height: 365px; "" /></p><h3>Real Estate RETS &amp; InstantSoftware Third Party Integration</h3><p>We assisted Prudential Gallo with switching from the old real estate data feed into the newer RETS based standard, allowing for faster, more consistent, and more reliable listing updates. During the course of this project, we collaborated with another company in the midwest to help develop a real estate integration solution for Drupal, called <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/drealty"" target=""_blank"">dRealty</a>. Our extensive experience with the Innovia system and close relationship with realtors gave us helpful insight and perspective for assisting in developing the module with other Drupal developers. The result is a ready to go data integration solution for Drupal that can work with many different real estate vendors, combined with the flexibility Drupal 7 can provide on the display side. We also built in additional features to add external data provided by Prugallo staff on real estate listings that can&#39;t be added through RETS.</p><p>On the rentals side, we fully integrated their Instant Software Rental Property management system into Drupal. Like real estate, rental properties are updated hourly to grab any new data, photos, or rental rates. Users can also book vacation rental properties directly on Prudential Gallo without ever leaving the website. Since we first introduced that change in 2009, they have had <strong>record breaking</strong> vacation rental bookings every single year since. Rental managers can also add additional data to rental properties that they can&#39;t do in Instant Software, such as add detailed bedding information, virtual tours, and have accurate mapping by dragging and dropping pins onto an interactive map.</p><p>Combined, there are over 14,000 listings between real estate and rentals, which can weigh heavily on any system. We took the time to integrate and cache the data behind Varnish and index listings with Apache Solr, boosting performance tenfold, making for a very snappy and responsive Drupal 7 site.</p><p style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/prugallo4_0.png"" style=""width: 630px; height: 400px; "" /></p><p><strong>Project Page</strong>: <a href=""http://www.inclind.com/our-work/prudential-gallo/detail.htm"">Prudential Gallo REALTORS</a></p><p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=""http://www.prugallo.com"" target=""_blank"">Prudential Gallo REALTORS</a></p>"," Web Design, rets, delaware real estate, drupal real estate, delaware beach rentals, drupal listing management, integrating instant software in drupal, openrealty in drupal"

471,Play Ball! Sports at the Beach Website has Launched!,2013-01-21,"<p><a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach</a>&nbsp;hosts youth baseball and softball tournaments. The 95 acre facility, located near the Delaware beaches, draws teams primarily from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. Inclind began its relationship with <a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach</a> in 2001, designing and constructing both public and private websites. Since then,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach</a>&nbsp;has flourished and has become the top attraction for youth baseball tournaments on the east coast other than Disney World&#39;s sports complex in Florida.</p><h2>From ColdFusion to Drupal</h2><p>The main objective of the project was to migrate the website away from the aging Coldfusion language to a powerful PHP application founded on <a href=""http://www.drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">Drupal</a>. The website was originally launched by Inclind in 2005 on Coldfusion 6, hosted on a dedicated Windows/MSSQL server. We re-architected the application in the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">Drupal</a>&nbsp;7 framework, leveraging it&#39;s combined capabilities of a CMS, CRM, and eCommerce system (via Drupal Commerce) to manage tournament products and tournament registrations, and provide a cleaner and more intuitive customer workflow from creating an account to registering a team and making registration payments.&nbsp;</p><h2>Migrating Ten Years of History</h2><p><a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach</a>&nbsp;database contains data going all the way back to 2002 when their very first system ran on top of an MS Access database (yep!). All of that history has been preserved and imported into their new system.</p><p>Utilizing Migrations, we were able to keep every single database record, normalize and clean the data for MySQL/Drupal, and fill in all the gaps that were lost over time either due to old bugs, mis-entries, or other anomalies. After a weeks worth of analysis of the MSSQL schema and data, we were able to craft a dozen Migration scripts to transpose the data over to MySQL. Since we use Migrations, we can quickly spot bad data coming in and stop and adjust the import, rollback and try again without any hassle. In the end, all of the 2 million database records made their way over. Migrating and importing a decade of content, users, orders, payments, registrations, tournaments, games and results took just around 3 hours (which is impressively fast for all that data to propogate through the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">Drupal</a>&nbsp;ecosystem!).&nbsp;</p><h2>Drupal Commerce &amp; Event Registration System</h2><p>The backbone of the site is a custom event registration system running on <a href=""http://www.drupalcommerce.org/"" target=""_blank"">Drupal Commerce</a>. Users who wish to sign their teams up for tournaments are actually submitting a registration for a tournament product, broken up by age brackets, and purchasing their slot on each respective tournament. To do this, we had to bypass the common workflow of ecommerce and not require payment upfront. Customers are allowed to pay as they go, with payments set forth as business rules so they can pay in increments and retain their spot in the tournament. If no payment is made in the given payment schedules, the slot is released, and another registered team can claim the spot.</p><p>To do this, we customized the experience and changed the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drupalcommerce.org/"" target=""_blank"">Drupal Commerce</a>&nbsp;workflow to bypass the payment screen if the user was registering for a tournament. Since there are plans to have a full merch store as well, the original workflow occurs if the customer is only buying a t-shirt or other physical item. Through some custom code and permission, a customer can complete the checkout of a registration without making a payment. After they checkout, their registration is submitted, at which point they can continue to their account overview and make a deposit or pay the full balance.</p><p>This flexibility keeps a maintainable structure to not only converting users, but keeping tournament registrant lists flexible right up to the week before a tournament. Teams can hop in and hop out at any time, and other teams can be shifted into their place by staff members without any fuss.</p><h2>Mobile First</h2><p><a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach&#39;s</a> new website was designed from the ground up to be &#39;<a href=""http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first"" target=""_blank"">mobile first</a>&#39;- meaning we focused on the mobile aspect before polishing the desktop experience. Everyone attending tournaments can pull up the website on their phone or tablet device and check the day&#39;s schedule and game results, which is critically important as people find themselves less and less at a desktop computer and more on the go. Their new website is implemented in a responsive design fashion- the website reacts and responds to the display screen. Not sure what that is? Try resizing your browser on their website to see it in action. Staff can also login from anywhere on the premisis and update scores or adjust the schedule on the spot without returning to the office.</p><h2>Cloud Hosted</h2><p>Our hosting company, <a href=""https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-managed-cloud"" target=""_blank"">Acquia</a>, has come through for us again providing us with a lightning fast server for our <a href=""http://www.drupal.org"" target=""_blank"">Drupal</a> application. Combined with technologies like Varnish and MemCached,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sportsatthebeach.com"" target=""_blank"">Sports at the Beach</a>&nbsp;can withstand traffic surges and spikes of thousands of users and still stay online, which is typical activity during a tournament in the summer. The user experiece is extremely fast and we are aiming to make them even faster.</p><p>Many moving pieces were involved in this conversion process. To address the specifics on how we achieved certain aspects of the system under&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drupalcommerce.org/"" target=""_blank"">Drupal Commerce</a>&nbsp;or custom data models (for you dev geeks), we will be writing more specific posts about how we accomplished those parts.

472,Custom Publishing Options' Hits 1000 Installations!,2013-01-29,"<p>Out of the box, Drupal comes with 3 workflow states for node types: Published, Sticky, and Promote to Frontpage. &#39;Published&#39; is useful enough to control if content is visible to non-administrative users, but what if you want to mark content as Archived, Featured, or other custom statuses? You could add a Field on the content type, but that comes with some overhead to manage across multiple content types. Plus, you have to remember to remove it from the display, and set user permissions on the Field. That&#39;s a lot of work for busy content creators!</p><p><a href=""http://drupal.org/project/custom_pub"" target=""_blank"" title=""Drupal Module - Custom Publishing Options | Inclind Inc"">Custom Publishing Options</a> extends the published status functionality of node content in Drupal to allow site administrators to define their own publish states. Each state is added to the database node schema and extends the node entity info to mark it as a property. This enables you to integrate custom states quickly into existing workflows, or develop new ones for content creators. This flexibility allows, for example, creating a View of nodes that are marked &#39;Archive&#39; or any custom status, without needing to unpublish them to filter them from other Views. You could also have a &#39;Featured&#39; status, to flag content for a slider rotation View, as well, it&#39;s really up to you.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Inclind Inc - Custom Publishing Options"" src=""/sites/default/files/cpo.png"" style=""width: 579px; height: 349px;"" /></p><p>We picked up and developed this module for Drupal 7 while working on a project for a local popular classifieds service in 2011.

477,Raspberry Pi + Dashing + Heroku Dashboard (Part 1),2013-08-16,"<p dir=""ltr"">One project we&#39;ve been after for a few years here at Inclind was having real-time dashboards around the office, pulling in data from around the net about our project data or headlines from Twitter and Reddit relevant to our business. With some extra HD TVs lying around and the affordable and powerful Raspberry Pi, it was a perfect time to revisit this idea. Combined with the power of Ruby, this was a snap.</p><p dir=""ltr"">After a couple of days, we setup the TVs around the office to show rotating data on an interactive display, here&#39;s how we did it.</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""/sites/default/files/dashboard.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/dashboard_0.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></a></p><h2 dir=""ltr"">You will need:</h2><ul dir=""ltr""><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Revision-512MB/dp/B009SQQF9C"" target=""_blank"">Raspberry Pi (Model B 512MB)</a></li><li>TV (HDMI input)</li><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Class-Flash-Memory-TS8GSDHC10E/dp/B003VNKNEG/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_img_z"" target=""_blank"">SDHC Flash Memory Card</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7811Un-Wireless-Adapter-Wizard/dp/B003MTTJOY/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_img_y"" target=""_blank"">Wifi Dongle</a></li><li>Keyboard</li><li>Mouse</li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">After acquiring the hardware you&rsquo;ll need an operating system (OS) to run the Raspberry Pi.

This post will discuss setting up the Dashing repository on your local computer and finish with a simple Heroku hosting solution.</p><p dir=""ltr"">I highly recommend navigating through the project page prior to working with any code. The purpose is to become familiar with the structure and organization of the Dashing framework. Do not be alarmed as you need not to be a Rubyist or have familiarity with the Ruby programming language to complete this setup.</p><p dir=""ltr"">One of the really cool abilities of the Dashing framework is the ability to pull data from external API&rsquo;s and display the data in any format. Examples of this are available for use <a href=""https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets"">here</a>. You may notice Kevin Quillen, Inclind Senior Developer and Architect, was able to implement a Reddit widget one evening after supper.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The core project structure is:</p><ul dir=""ltr""><li>assets/ (<em>css/js/fonts/images</em>)</li><li>jobs/ (<em>your logic for making http/https requests and transforming any API data</em>)</li><li>dashboard/ (<em>layout templates in .erb</em>)</li><li>widgets/ (<em>individual widgets composed of Coffescript, Sass, and HTML</em>)</li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">The framework also includes many libraries that implement the latest HTML5 web standards. Most notably would be <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbatmanjs.org%2F&amp;ei=A4ETUvi-EcWy4AOeuoH4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyF-AR8lyocoyWRuNPax31oXnFwg&amp;bvm=bv.50952593,d.dmg"" target=""_blank"">Batman.js</a>.</p><p>To begin working with your code base it is assumed that Ruby gem installation can be facilitated on your local computer.

For those not familiar, Heroku is a flexible hosting solution that can accommodate the Dashing framework dependencies. Not to mention free for limited use!</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Option 1</strong> is much more difficult to implement. You will need to configure the Raspberry Pi with many tools in order for it to run. The Inclind project team collectively decided against this option. Caveats in speed and performance being the main criterion. If your interested in this solution you may look to this post <a href=""https://gist.github.com/stonehippo/5896381"">https://gist.github.com/stonehippo/5896381</a> (untested) for better direction.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Option 2</strong> is the most common. You&rsquo;ll need to go to <a href=""https://www.heroku.com/"">https://www.heroku.com/</a> and register for a free account in order for this to work. Upon setting up an account on Heroku you will need to add your SSH credentials to the account.

480,Setting Up Android's Virtual Device,2013-09-14,"<p>After installing Android&#39;s SDK Emulator several times on OSX, I decided it was time to document it and make it really easy for anybody else at the office to get setup. If you&#39;re wondering how to get your work station setup and running Android emulations, here are some easy to follow instructions for you to use.</p><p>Android SDK allows us to test Android devices on our computers. Depending on what is being accomplished, it may suffice to simply switch your browser&rsquo;s User Agent to simulate an Android device. I recommend using User Agent Switcher for Chrome. ( <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg?hl=en-US""> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg?hl=en-US</a> )</p><ol><li>Download the SDK ADT Bundle for Mac. <a href=""http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html""> http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a></li><li>Extract the ZIP File into the Applications folder of your computer.</li><li>Rename the extracted folder to SDK or something that will be easy for you to remember.</li><li>Navigate to the following item inside the SDK Directory.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDK &gt; sdk &gt; tools &gt; android .</li><li>Double click to open [you may have to right click to open depending on your comptuer&rsquo;s security settings.</li><li>Viewing the Android SDK Manager Window, you will now need to install a few packages to get your emulators started. Download the the most recent 3 or 4 Android Packages, and make sure to install Intel x86 Emulator Accelrator (HAXM). This will make your emulator faster.</li></ol><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><img height=""476px;"" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lJUT6d4B8FxCjlJ_uYWafTm9PxNMCbzFA5G3_mtqlm-cc6Rm2hgtc81H3mEKV8Ck213uwCpr8TO1aemlLmJAiBxozr-4pBlhcnOPO7Q52kS4L9C7fp3QYRImtA"" width=""380px;"" /></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">You should have all the packages which are checked off in this screenshot.</p><ol start=""7""><li>Make sure you accept all the license agreements and start the download. It will take a while to download all of the packages, be patient.</li><li>In order to get the HAXM Emulator Excelerator to work, you must install the following driver from Intel. <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager""> http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager</a>.&nbsp;Just download and follow the installation instructions, simple enough.</li><li>Almost finished! Once your packages are finished installing, we simply have to create a new emulator to use. In the toolbar, go to Tools &gt; Manage AVDs.</li><li>Click New... to create a new Android Virtual Device. It may be wise to name it after the device you use to create it. For example, you could name it Nexus 7, Galaxy Nexus, or 4.0&rdquo; WVGA. This will help if you have multiple later and you need them organized.</li><li>Choose any device to get started, and make sure you can choose Intel Atom under the CPU drop down window. This Intel Atom setting will make your emulator run at a speed that isn&rsquo;t super slow. Click OK when you&rsquo;re ready.</li><li>Click on your new emulator device and click Start. You should be good to go now.!</li></ol>"," Development, Testing, Android, Mobile Testing"
481,ZURB Foundation Nation,2014-02-24,"<p>Inclind has been doing responsive design and responsive websites since early 2011. Along the way we have learned all the ins and outs of working with responsive design and grid frameworks to facilitate it. We&#39;ve tried them all - from Omega, to Twitter Bootstrap, to Blueprint, Base, and Gumby.</p><p>We settled on Foundation when it was clear that it is the perfect tool for the job. We have embraced it and Zurb&#39;s toolsets and provided solutions for Drupal across the board.</p><blockquote style=""background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #CC0000;""><p style=""margin: 0;""><a href=""http://foundation.zurb.com/business/services.html"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank""><strong>Foundation is the first and most advanced responsive, front-end framework in the world.</strong></a></p></blockquote><p>Our diligence and collaboration with the Drupal community has helped us achieve a simultaneous triple release for all major versions of Foundation supporting 3, 4, and now 5, for anyone out there on those platforms.</p><p>Along with that, we have released modules to work with and enable functionality from all of the plugins in the Zurb Foundation package making things super simple to put a responsive site together fast with slideshows, lightboxed photo galleries, responsive images, and responsive accordion / tab content elements.</p><h3>Seeing is believing.</h3><p>Foundation has enabled us to do some of our best work yet with none of the old browser/device hurdles.
